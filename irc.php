					<h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>
In order to provide faster, free flow of information for MAME's 
developers and users, the MAME team has set up two IRC channels.
                    </p>
                 
                 	<h2>Rules</h2>
                    <p>
The most important rule is <i>don't be an ass</i>. If you're on 
good behavior and treat others well, you'll be treated well. Also 
see <a href="http://freenode.net/kb/answer/conduct">freenode's code 
of conduct</a>.
                    </p>

                 	<h2>Where</h2>
                    <p>
The official location of MAME's IRC channels is <b>irc.freenode.net</b>
                    </p>
					<p>
Channel <b>#mame</b> is used for user support and general social 
discussion. This channel does not require that you register your 
nickname.
					</p>
					<p>
Channel <b>#mame-dev</b> is used for developer discussion. 
It is NOT a MAME-usage support channel, and user questions will be
directed to <b>#mame</b>. This channel DOES require nickname 
registration. See <a href="http://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration">
the instructions</a> on nickname registration for further details.
