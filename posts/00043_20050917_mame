Site Updates

<p>
Now that 0.100 is behind us, I've made some changes and updates to the 
site. First, I've rearranged the links to the left into more groups with 
fewer items; hopefully it will be easier to quickly find links that way.
</p>

<p>
There are also several new pages. First, I added a page explaining how 
you can <a href="http://mamedev.com/contribute.html">help 
us out</a> if you're interested. We often get questions about this 
and I figured it was time to spell out the best ways of helping out the 
MAME development effort.
</p>

<p>
If you're a coder and are looking to contribute source code changes, there 
is also a new page <a href="http://mamedev.com/submit.html">documenting 
the submission guidelines</a>. Make sure you read this before sending 
in source updates. It also has a section giving some ideas for those who 
are just getting started and want to know how to make a difference.
</p>

<p>
There's also a new <a href="http://mamedev.com/romsfaq.html">ROM 
and Image File FAQ</a> that I've added to the legal section. I've 
seen numerous threads on message boards with tons of flat-out-incorrect 
information about the legality of buying, selling, and using ROM files. 
This FAQ attempts to address most of the common questions.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I've updated the <a href="http://mamedev.com/links.html">Links</a> 
page with pointers to some recently-added WIP pages and other resources.
