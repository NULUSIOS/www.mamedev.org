MAME 0.126

<p>
At last, it is time for a full MAME update: grab MAME 0.126 from the <a 
href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest Release</a> 
page.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the usual large pile of changes and improvements, there 
are several big changes come along with this release that you should be 
aware of:<br/>
<ol><br/>
	<li>The new universal recompiler engine is now live and running. 
Both the MIPS3 and PowerPC CPU cores have been ported over to it. Most 
games should be working about as well as they did before, and should be 
at full speed on both 32-bit and 64-bit Intel processors.</li><br/>
	<li>The MAME debugger is now included in all builds; just add the 
-debug option and you can use it from any 0.126 or later binary. This means 
the focus of the "debug build" is now to enable assertions and 
to make it easier to debug the MAME code itself.</li><br/>
	<li>The cheat engine is currently undergoing some major renovations. 
It is largely functional but still has some rough edges. If there are specific 
things wrong with it, please report the bugs over at <a href="http://mametesters.org/" 
target="_blank">MAMETesters</a>, so that they get fixed 
during the 0.127 development cycle.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Hopefully we'll get back to a normal 1 month development cycle starting 
with the next release. In the meantime, enjoy the update!
