MAME 0.118u5

<p>
One more (last?) update release for 0.118 has been posted on the <a 
href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest Release</a> 
page. This update features more progress on the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/cubocd32.c" 
target="_blank">Cubo CD32</a> games, thanks to Ernesto, 
some additional <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/srch.php?manu=678" 
target="_blank">Subsino</a> games and a couple of Mahjong 
games from Luca Elia, a fixed <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/mappy" 
target="_blank">Mappy</a> driver with priorities working 
again, and some significant cleanup in the internal palette management 
code. There is also as promised a new parameter -refreshspeed which automatically 
adjusts the -speed of gameplay to keep it under your monitor's refresh 
rate. Give it a whirl.
</p>

<p>
This update should also compile cleanly with the <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools">latest 
development tools</a>, based on gcc 4.2.1. Make sure you grab the 
latest tools to ensure that your builds go smoothly.
</p>

<p>
As this is expected to be the final intermediate update in the 0.119 development 
cycle, please give it a try and report any problems to <a href="http://mametesters.org"
