MAME 0.99u9

<p>
Wasn't intending to hit 9 intermediates, but with all the changes this 
version, it's best to make sure things are stable. Also, quite a number 
of Namco games get sound with this update &mdash; <a href="http://mamedev.com/source.html">check 
it out!</a> Report bugs on <a href="http://www.mametesters.org/">MAME 
Testers</a> ASAP if you find anything new with this version.
