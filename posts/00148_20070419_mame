MAME 0.114u2

<p>
Time for another <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">update 
to MAME 0.114</a>. This week's update features full discrete audio 
for <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/invaders" target="_blank">Space 
Invaders</a> thanks to Derrick, a number of great bugfixes from couriersud, 
some more Konami improvements from Ville, and some more movement of previously 
Windows-specific code into the core. As usual, keep reporting those bugs 
over at <a href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAME 
Testers</a>!
