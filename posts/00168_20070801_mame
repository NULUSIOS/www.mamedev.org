MAME 0.117u3

<p>
Now available for <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">download</a> 
is the latest update to MAME 0.117. This version is mostly internal changes 
and important bugfixes to the input system and the frontend menus. In addition, 
we have a preliminary Sega laserdisc game driver thanks to Andrew Gardner, 
further extensions to the built-in multi-segment LED support from James 
Wallace, and a new tool that converts the MAME source tree into HTML for 
browsing. You can see it in action by clicking on the new "Browse 
Source Code" link to the left. (Note that the total source code weighs 
in at over 100MB, so please be patient while it uploads!)

<p>
One side effect of the changes is that you will need updated ctrlr files 
if you currently rely on the ctrlr support. They will be included with 
the next binary release, but until then, you can grab them <a href="http://mamedev.org/newctrlr.zip">here</a>.

<p>
Make sure you report any more issues with the new input code soon over 
at <a href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAME 
Testers</a>. Depending on the feedback, we will either move forward 
with the 0.118 release or hold off and do a u4 update.
