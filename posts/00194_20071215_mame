Small Changes

<p>
There have been a couple of small changes to the way file downloads are 
handled on this site. <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a>, which are still on their own page, will continue to 
be hosted here directly. However, for larger files, it is becoming necessary 
to rely on mirror sites to keep under bandwidth limitations. In order to 
facilitate this, the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> and <a href="http://mamedev.org/oldrel.html">Previous 
Releases</a> pages now select a mirror at random when you click 
the Download link. Depending on the mirror site, this may be either a direct 
link to the file, or in some case might require a redirect to the mirror 
site where the download will auto-initiate after a few seconds.

<p>
While we all definitely prefer a simpler mechanism, this one seems a good 
compromise given current realities.

Another change you probably won't notice is that the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a>, <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a>, and <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/">Source 
Code Browser</a> pages are all now auto-generated based on which 
files are on the server. This certainly makes my life a little easier.

Special thanks to s_bastian and Twisty for help with the backend coding!
