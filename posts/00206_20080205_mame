MAME 0.123

<p>
Most of the glitches in 0.122u8 should be taken care of, so it's time to 
salute MAME's 11th birthday with a <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">nice 
new release</a>.

(Apologies in advance for the cut-off text in the whatsnew; it should read 
"Fixed incorrect default screen size in midyunit games." It wasn't 
a big enough error to prompt a recall!)
