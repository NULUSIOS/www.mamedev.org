MAME 0.122u4

<p>
A little early, but there has been a ton of activity in the last few days, 
so now is the right time for <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">an 
update</a>. What's new? Over 40 <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAMETesters</a> bugfixes, for a start! 
Read about the rest of it in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0122u4.txt">whatsnew</a>.

Edit: due to an unexplained glitch, I had to break this patch into two 
pieces. Apply them both. If you already tried to apply the original single 
patch and failed, then simply applying the second part should give you 
a working result. Sorry for the inconvenience!
