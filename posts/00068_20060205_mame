MAME 0.104, take 2

<p>
A last minute bug was found that caused -listxml to crash. If you downloaded 
the source and it has this crash, I've put up a fixed set of sources (same 
name).

<p>
If you already downloaded the sources and want a quick fix, just grab and 
apply <a href="http://mamedev.org/104fix.zip">this diff</a>.
