MAME 0.111u4

<p>
Yet another triple-digit update (i.e., greater than 100k). I did some internal 
core shuffling again involving bitmap formats and how game drivers control 
which formats to use. Hopefully nothing broke too badly, but some regex 
search and replace was involved, so there could be an issue or two.

Also, please take note of the previous news entry -- the RSS feed link 
has changed, so update your readers if you haven't done so yet.
