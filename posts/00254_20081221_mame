MAME 0.128u7

<p>
As of <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">this release</a>, we have 
two more major changes. These should be the last "huge" changes of this 
dev cycle. 
</p>

<p>
The most major change is the final retirement of the global Machine
pointer, which has been part of MAME for many years. Frankly, I never
thought we'd hit this point so quickly, so my hats off to Atari Ace
who helped push through the final round of changes needed to make this
happen finally. As a result of this change, it should be possible in
the coming year to finally write a driver that runs two full machines
simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
The second big change is that the CPUs are now full-fledged devices, 
and participate like all other devices in the system configuration.
This is mainly an internal structural change, but in the end removes
some redundant code and behavior. In a future dev cycle, a similar
thing will happen with the sound cores.
</p>

<p>
Starting now, the focus for MAME will be to iron out remaining issues
and release a 0.129 sometime around the 1st of the year. Please keep
reporting bugs to <a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis" target="blank">
MAMETesters</a> as you find things.
