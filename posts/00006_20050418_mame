So Long Haze, and Thanks for All the Fish

<p>
As has been widely reported, <a href="http://haze.mameworld.info/">Haze</a> 
has decided to step down as maintainer of MAME. During his time as maintainer, 
he managed to accomplish a lot in terms of accelerating the pace of development 
and keeping the releases coming at a regular rate. Fortunately, he won't 
be giving up MAME for good. Here's hoping that some time away from being 
maintainer will do him some good, or at the very least produce more accurate 
emulation of Korean porn titles. :-)

Following in his wake, <a href="http://aarongiles.com">Aaron 
Giles</a> (that's me) will be stepping in to take over the role of 
maintainer. The first major side effect of this transition is that you 
will no longer find the intermediate updates at Haze's site, but rather 
you will find them here. Well, not here on this page, but <a href="http://mamedev.com/source.html">over 
here</a> on the sources page.

In fact, if you check it out now, you'll see that I've put up a 0.95u3 
update. I should point out that I am using a different tool to generate 
the diffs, which means that you no longer apply them with the -p1 parameter, 
but instead use -p0. Apart from that, it shouldn't be too much of a change 
from before.
