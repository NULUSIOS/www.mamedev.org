At Last, Some Modern Build Tools

<p>
After being stuck using gcc 3.4.5 for a very, very long time, the <a 
href="http://mingw.org" target="_blank">MinGW</a> 
developers have released a "prerelease" build of gcc 4.2.1. After 
some basic smoke testing, this version of gcc appears to work fine for 
building MAME, minus a couple of minor warnings which have been cleared 
up for the next release. The <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools">Development 
Tools</a> page has now been updated with a fresh package of build 
tools and links to all the components.
</p>

<p>
If you download these tools now, you should still be able to build MAME, 
but you will need to disable -Werror with any version of MAME prior to 
0.118u5 (which is not yet released), since there are some new warnings 
which need to be dealt with (really, not that many).
