Releases</a> page.

This past month we've had a lot of excitement and improvements to the code. 
Most visible is of course the quick progress on the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/cps3.c" 
target="_blank">CPS-3</a> games, which are now all fully 
working and playable thanks to the work of Andreas Naive, Haze, ElSemi, 
R. Belmont and others. Phil Stroffolino returned from an extended absence 
and contributed a mostly working <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/djboy" 
target="_blank">DJ Boy</a> driver. Adam Bousley brought 
the early Taito classic <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/changela" 
target="_blank">Change Lanes</a> into a working state. 
In addition, Zsolt took yet another crack at making the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/neodrvr.c" 
target="_blank">Neo-Geo</a> driver more accurate and 
made some substantial improvements. Zsolt also took on the task of removing 
some legacy code which had been sitting around for years, updating many 
drivers to use more recent timing functions.

And in an odd twist of fate, this release marks the first time we have 
preliminary (read: not working yet) support for a bootleg arcade multigame 
system â€” based on an earlier hacked up version of MAME. In our 
attempts to document arcade history it seems we have inadvertently become 
a part of arcade history....
