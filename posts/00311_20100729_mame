MAME 0.139

<p>
MAME 0.139 is now available, go get it at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest Release</a> page.
</p>

<p>
You may notice the download sizes to be ~1MB larger for the binary releases. This is due to a bit of EXE bloat
from the C++ conversion work (which is still in progress), plus the addition of a rather large .sym file. Keep
this .sym file next to your executable so that if you encounter any crashes, you will get useful call stacks that
you can report over at <a href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAMETesters</a>.
