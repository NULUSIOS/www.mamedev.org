MAME 0.124a

<p>
Take two of MAME 0.124 is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release page</a>. This update supplants the previous release. If 
you downloaded a binary previously, you'll need to grab a new one. If you 
downloaded the sources, you can either grab a fresh copy or <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/0124a_diff.zip">apply 
this patch</a> to the ones you downloaded. You can identify the fixed 
one in that it reports version 0.124a if you run it with -help, or in the 
version.c file.

Apologies for the excitement today! :)
