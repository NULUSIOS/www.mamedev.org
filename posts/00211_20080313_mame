MAME 0.123u5

<p>
Another week, another big update. Grab it from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a> page.
</p>

<p>
There have been a number of substantial internal changes recently. A lot 
of this is related to some long-term plans I have around unifying the various 
device types, removing arbitrary limits, getting rid of hacky old systems, 
and implementing some core features that have long been requested. I want 
to extend a special thanks to Zsolt Vasvari who has been doing a lot of 
the dirty work involved in these changes.
</p>

<p>
Consider the most recent changes a bit of internal "spring cleaning", 
and keep an eye out for bugs that might creep in as a result. As you can 
see from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0123u5.txt">whatsnew</a>, 
we are tracking new bugs on the new and improved <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAMETesters site</a>, so please make 
sure you <a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis" target="_blank">register 
with the bug database</a> and log anything that seems to be amiss.
