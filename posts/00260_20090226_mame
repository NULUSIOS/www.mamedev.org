MAME 0.129u5

<p>
Still cleaning up the big device-ification mess from last version. Most all reported
bugs are fixed now, so hopefully we are on the home stretch. Please grab the latest
<a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">0.129u5 update</a> and verify that everything
you care about is working fine and playing sounds as expected. And while you're at it,
try out a few games you <i>don't</i> care about. Who knows, you might discover something new!

<p>
Once again, please report all issues over at
<a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis" target="blank">MAMETesters</a> to ensure they
get proper attention. You will notice the large list of fixed bugs at the top of the
<a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0129u5.txt">whatsnew.txt</a>. If it's not
reported, don't assume we know about it!
