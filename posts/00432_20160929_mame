Micko at CppCon 2016

<p>On Thursday last week, our very own Miodrag “Micko” Milanović gave a
presentation at <a href="http://cppcon.org/">CppCon</a> 2016.  He
covered the project’s history, goals, and current direction, before
talking about some of the technologies we use and our experiences
modernising the codebase.  It’s a bit over an hour long, and not overly
technical.  The slides are available <a

github</a>.</p>
