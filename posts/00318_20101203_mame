Bandwidth Issues

<p>
Well it looks like we've hit some issues with our primary mirror. If anyone out there has
the bandwidth to support mirroring the MAME releases, please 
<a href="http://mamedev.org/contact2.html">contact me</a>.
Until this is sorted, the full release downloads will be offline. Sorry for the
inconvenience.
