MAME 0.141u4

<p>
At last, MAME 0.141u3 is now posted to the
<a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Latest Updates</a> page.
The megatech.xml hash file included here is intended to be placed
in a "hash" directory next to the MAME executable. We are still
working to resolve how this will play out in the final 0.142 release,
which you can expect to see appear in a week or so if all goes
according to plan.
