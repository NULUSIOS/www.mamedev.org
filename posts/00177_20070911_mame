MAME 0.118u6

<p>
Okay, so the last release needed a little more bake time before we were 
ready to go out the door. Thus we have MAME 0.118u6, now available on the 
<a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest Release</a> 
page. This one fixes all of the reported issues I could find. It also features 
keys for the final two CPS2 games, thanks to Haze and Nicola, a bunch of 
new clones now that Haze is back from holidays, and a long-lost Exidy 440 
game Yukon, thanks to the sharp eyes of long-time dev at a local flea 
market (seriously!)

This is definitely your last chance to report bugs before 0.119 is released, 
so please give it a one-over and report issues over at <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAME Testers</a>. Thanks!

(Edit: Oops, looks like there was a little mix-up in putting this together, 
and a few of the clones [turpins, opwolfa, starforb] plus the srmp6 update 
didn't actually make it into this update; they will be in 0.119.)
