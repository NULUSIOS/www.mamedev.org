Oops

<p>
Early reports on 0.95u4 seem to indicate that it doesn't let you type "OK" 
at the various intro screens. It works fine if you disable the disclaimer 
and game info screens and don't play games with any warnings. Turns out 
that's what I did to test it anyway. ;-)

Look for a u5 later this evening (PDT) to fix it!
