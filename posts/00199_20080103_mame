New ROMS from Exidy

<p>
Thanks to the very kind generosity of mr H.R. Kaufmann, president of Xidy, 
now owner of the Exidy trademark, we have been allowed more ROM for free, 
personal non-commercial use. You can get them in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms/">ROM 
Page</a>, Targ and Spectar are the new additions, and more to come!
