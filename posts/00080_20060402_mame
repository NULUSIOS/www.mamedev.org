MAME 0.104u9

<p>
Fixing one of the remaining issues was a bit too invasive to risk going 
straight to 0.105, so u9 is <a href="http://mamedev.org/source.html">now 
available</a>. Please make sure existing save state functionality 
still works (though the save states are likely to be incompatible due to 
a limitation in the current architecture).
