Three More From Exidy

<p>
I'm pleased to announce that we have three more classic games from Exidy 
now available for free download. All three games hail from 1979. <a 
href="http://mamedev.org/roms/crash">Crash</a> is a 
classic black &amp; white car-in-a-maze game. <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms/fireone">Fire 
One!</a> is a two-player submarine game in full color. And <a 
href="http://mamedev.org/roms/ripcord">Rip Cord</a> 
is a challenging skydiving game. Once again, I'd like to thank H.R. Kaufmann 
of Xidy, Inc. for allowing us to make these ROMs available for free, non-commercial 
use.
