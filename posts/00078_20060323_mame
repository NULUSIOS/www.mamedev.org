MAME 0.104u7

<p>
The 7th update to MAME 0.104 is now avaialble <a href="http://mamedev.org/source.html">here</a>. 
As far as I know, all newly-introduced bugs due to the core changes have 
been fixed. If you find anything else that is broken, please let <a 
href="http://mametesters.org/">MAMETesters</a> know 
right away. Barring any significant issues, we should have a MAME 0.105 
soon.
