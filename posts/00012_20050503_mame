MAME 0.96 Released

<p>
The latest version of MAME is now 0.96. I won't have time to update the 
official releases page until later this evening, but if you use your incredible 
powers of induction, you can guess what the URL of the source most likely 
is. Updates to <a href="http://www.mame.net">mame.net</a> 
should happen soon as well.

And hey, look, it appears that a MAME32 build is already available. :-)
