Download Issues Resolved

<p>
Thanks to everyone who offered to mirror the files. We are currently 
setting up 4-5 mirrors to spread the load, and so far 3 of them are online,
so downloads should be working again. Mirror selection is random for the
moment, so it should all be effectively transparent.
