Developer Docs Update!

<p>
After realizing it was hopeless to write a comprehensive set of documents 
on how MAME works, I've reorganized the developer docs section so that 
it hosts a collection of shorter articles about various aspects of MAME. 
Most of these are taken from <a href="http://aarongiles.com">my 
blog</a>, but hopefully the shorter format will be more enticing 
to other devs who want to help out. Look for a series of articles on adding 
save states to drivers coming soon!
