New Game Available!

<p>
I've recently been in contact with Duncan Brown, the guy who wrote <b>Alien 
Arena</b>, which was recently added to MAME. <b>Alien Arena</b> 
was an entirely new game (in 1985) that was designed to run on the classic 
Williams hardware. Duncan owned an arcade at that time, and he actually 
put the game on location there with the hopes of making it into a more 
widely distributed conversion kit for arcade operators.

Duncan has been kind enough to allow us to make his game available free 
for non-commercial use, just like the other games in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms">ROM 
Images</a> section. So I invite you to <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms/alienar">check 
it out</a>, read more about the history of the game, and enjoy playing 
something new. Duncan has even provided his email address in the enclosed 
readme, so feel free to drop him and line and let him know what you thought 
about it!
