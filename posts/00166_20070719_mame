MAME 0.117u1

<p>
And now time for a big update. Head on over to the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page and grab the 0.117u1 release. Make sure you check

<p>
The first major change in this release is the input system. The way that 
the OS-specific layer communicates with the core about input devices has 
changed substantially, allowing a lot of the tricky functionality to be 
handled automatically by the core code. For the Windows build specifically, 
this marks a shift in behavior: on Windows XP and later, both keyboard 
and mouse now use the raw input APIs, which allow support for multiple 
keyboards and mice.
</p>

<p>
A second big change is an experimental one. A new built-in user interface 
is provided for selecting a game. This interface is intended to be minimal 
and will not serve to replace a true frontend. However, it does provide 
a better first experience for those unfamiliar with MAME and is useful 
for launching a game when you can't remember the exact driver name.
