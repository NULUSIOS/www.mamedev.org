MAME 0.115u4

<p>
A new update to MAME 0.115 is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Releases</a> page. This release features connected inputs in <a 
href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/aceattaa" target="_blank">Ace 
Attacker</a>, thanks to Barry Gemma; some more driver improvements 
from Zsolt; and some code simplification throughout the system. There is 
a small chance of a regression or two as a result, so if something looks 
odd, please make sure you report it to <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAME Testers</a>, as always.
