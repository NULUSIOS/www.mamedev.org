MAME 0.130u3

<p>
There's a new update now available: <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">MAME 0.130u3</a>.
This update changes the way crosshairs work. If want to experiment with custom crosshairs you
can <a href="http://mamedev.org/crsshair.zip">grab this file</a>, which contains PNGs of the
built-in crosshairs, as a starting point.
