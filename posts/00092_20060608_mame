MAME 0.106u5

<p>
Another release is now available at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">releases 
page</a>. This one is a bit experimental again in that multiple threads 
are now being used. I'd especially like your testing if you have a hyperthreaded 
or dual core machine to see how the system behaves. There is definitely 
some more tweaking needed in the unthrottled case, but normal execution 
should be fine.
