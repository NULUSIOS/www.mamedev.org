Old MAME WIP Reports Now Available

<p>
From <a href="http://mamedev.org/oldwip/wip9902.html">Feburary 
1999</a> through <a href="http://mamedev.org/oldwip/wip0407.html">July 
2004</a>, Santeri Saarimaa took on the challenging task of maintaining 
a detailed daily work-in-progress report of MAME development. These pages represent 
a peek into what was happening during one of the most active times in the 
project's development.
</p>

<p>
These reports were previously hosted over at <a href="http://mame.net" 
target="_blank">mame.net</a>, but as part of a process 
of consolidating content between that site and this one, they are now hosted 
here. You can access them via the new "Past WIP Reports" link 
on the lefthand side.
