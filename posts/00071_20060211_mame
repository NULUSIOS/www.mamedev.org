Site Updates

<p>
A couple of new changes to the site. First is a new section containing 
links to the <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools">Development 
Tools</a> that are used to build MAME under Windows. This information 
has been floating around in a readme file, but it's much nicer in this 
format. Plus, there is now an almost all-in-one package available with 
all the tools that makes setup much easier. Note that you should hold off 
using the new tools until the next <a href="http://mamedev.org/source.html">intermediate 
release</a> due to a dependence on the header file multimon.h, which 
I am fixing in u2.
</p>

<p>
The second change is an update to the <a href="http://mamedev.org/ebay.html">eBay 
Policies</a> to make a few things clearer, specifically emphasizing 
the cases where referencing MAME in any way makes us very unhappy.
</p>

<p>
Still more to come in the near future, including a new addition to the 
<a href="http://mamedev.org/roms">ROM Images</a> 
section (and no, it's not <b>Poly Play</b>!)
</p>
