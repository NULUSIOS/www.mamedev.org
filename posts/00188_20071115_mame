MAME 0.120u4

<p>
Time for the weekly MAME update; grab it from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Apologies if you have tried to grab a full release or development tools 
over the past few days. I am currently experimenting with techniques to 
be nicer on this server, since it is a shared server and MAME can suck 
up an awful lot of bandwidth! As of tonight, all the full releases are 
now mirrored over at the old mame.net site, and links are appropriately 
updated here. The only thing missing is the development tools, which I 
hope to have back online shortly.
