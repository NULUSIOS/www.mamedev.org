MAME 0.125u1

<p>
The first update to MAME 0.125 is now posted on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a> page.
</p>

<p>
The big news in this release is that <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/wrally" 
target="_blank">World Rally</a> -- long thought to be 
unemulatable -- is now up and running, thanks to some help from Gaelco 
S.A. directly! Even more exciting is that Gaelco has officially offered 
the <a href="http://www.gaelco.com/english/pages/hablando/frhablan.htm" 
target="_blank">World Rally ROMs for free download on their 
site</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please note carefully that these World Rally ROMs are only available 
for personal, non-commercial use. In fact, there is already concern that 
some folks are out to make a buck off of the released ROMs, since they 
include the coveted protected Dallas code. If we hope to get additional 
help in the future, please do not abuse the kindness of the folks at Gaelco!
