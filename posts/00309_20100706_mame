MAME 0.138u3

<p>
Another bunch of internal shuffling this round, but also some new MCU hookups
as well, thanks to the decapping effort. Most of the regressions and 
performance losses from u2 should be fixed now as well. So go grab the u3 update from 
<a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">the Source Updates</a> page.
