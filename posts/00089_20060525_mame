MAME 0.106u2

<p>
Well, here it is: <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">the 
long-awaited video update</a> in MAME 0.106u2. A few important notes 
about this release.
</p>

<p>
First, the new video system is not enabled by default. To enable it, you 
need to enable the NEW_RENDER makefile flag and recompile the entire project.
</p>

<p>
Second, if you previously configured MAME to use DirectDraw (which was 
the previous default), then you will get software-only rendering by default. 
You need to explicitly enable Direct3D rendering (-d3d) in order to get 
hardware acceleration. Software rendering is not very fast, especially 
at high resolutions.
