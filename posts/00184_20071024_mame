This update features a number of nice enhancements. Phil has submitted 
his <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/namcos21.c" 
target="_blank">System 21</a> changes, so all those 
games should be looking significantly better this time around. In addition, 
a more generic polygon rendering system has been added which makes it much 
easier for games to offload their rasterization to a second CPU. So far, 
the <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/video/voodoo.c.html">Voodoo</a> 
emulation, <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/gaelco3d.c" 
target="_blank">Gaelco 3D</a> system, <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/midvunit.c" 
target="_blank">Midway V-Unit</a>, and <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/namcos22.c" 
target="_blank">Namco System 22</a> have been updated 
to take advantage of it. Some games do better than others, but if you have 
a multicore machine, this release should show some noticeably improved 
framerates for those games.
