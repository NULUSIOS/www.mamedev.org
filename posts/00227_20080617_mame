MAME 0.125u6

<p>
The latest in the now long-running series of updates to MAME 0.125 is <a 
href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">now available</a>. 
There will likely be at least two more intermediate updates before 0.126, 
due to the large number of changes in the dynamic recompilers and elsewhere 
in the system. So hang in there and please give these updates a try to 
ensure that everything still works as expected. As usual, report your bugs 
over at <a href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAMETesters</a>.
