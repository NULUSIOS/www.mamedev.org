MAME 0.118u1

<p>
Get the first update to MAME 0.118 over at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. This major change this time around is an internally 
revamped tilemap system. A set of regression tests have already been done 
and things look pretty good, so I don't anticipate a lot of new bugs with 
the new code, but there will probably be a few things I missed. Make sure 
you read the top of tilemap.h (either in the source or in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/tilemap.h.html">online 
source</a> when it is updated later today) for more detail on how 
the tilemap system works.
