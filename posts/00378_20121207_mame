New tools

<p>
We introduce a new toolchain which contains mingw tools based on GCC 4.6.3 + QT4 + Python<br/>
Obtain these new packages from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools/">Development Tools</a> page.<br> 
<br/>
Note that in new tools there is Python support and also QT4 libraries<br/>
<br/>
After unpacking start setup-Qt.bat to create needed config file for QT4<br/>
and also use setup-Python.bat to setup Python support<br/>
<br/>
