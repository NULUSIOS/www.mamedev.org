MAME 0.106u12

<p>
Getting close now. This update includes a newly rewritten windows.txt describing 
all the options in their new arrangements, and some updates to the -listxml 
output to represent multiple displays and input controls. If you are a 
frontend author, this release is something you will want to pay attention 
to!
