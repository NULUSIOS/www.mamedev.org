A Pair of Exidy Classics

<p>
This month I'm proud to add two more classic Exidy games to the collection 
of freely-available ROM images. The first game is <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms/sidetrac">Side 
Trak</a>, which shares some common elements with <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms/crash">Crash</a>, 
but features trains instead of cars and a bit less control over your destiny 
thanks to the fact that track changes by the computer's train affect your 
path as well.
</p>

<p>
In addition to Side Trak, we have also added a page for <a href="http://mamedev.org/roms/starfire">Star 
Fire</a>, an obviously Star Wars-inspired game that represented a 
number of firsts in the industry, including the first environmental cabinet 
and the first game to let you enter your initials when you got a high score. 
The ROMs for the unreleased "sequel" (really just a small revision) 
Star Fire 2 are also available on the same page.

<p>
As a gentle reminder, I want to point out that although these Exidy ROM 
images are freely available here for non-commercial use, there is no 
implied license for other sites or mechanisms to distribute them. If you 
are interested in distributing or making use of these ROM images apart 
from running them in MAME for your own personal use, please fill out the 
<a href="http://mamedev.org/contact.html?legal">contact 
form</a> on this site with a description of what you wish to do, 
and we will make an effort to put you in touch with the appropriate people.
