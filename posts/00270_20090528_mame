MAME 0.131u3

<p>
Apologies for the one week delay, but vacation was a higher priority! Anyway,
we are back with another update, so head over to the
<a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source Updates</a> page to grab the
lastest changes. I anticipate one more intermediate update before we move on
to 0.132, so get your bug reports into <a href="http://mametesters.org">MAMETesters</a>
soon if you want to see something fixed before then.
