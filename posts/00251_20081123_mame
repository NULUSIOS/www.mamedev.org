MAME 0.128u4

<p>
After two weeks, it is finally time for MAME 0.128u4. But be warned: this
version contains some significant changes internally. The end goal is to
make MAME more "object-oriented" which in turn will allow MAME to context
switch between CPUs at a faster clip. Unfortunately, due to MAME's legacy
architecture, this ends up being a somewhat painful change.

If you're brave, want to help out, or at least want to be in sync with the
latest code, grab it from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source Updates</a>
page. Please make sure bugs are reported to <a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis">MAMETesters</a>.

<p>
If you're a coder and inclined to make or suggest sweeping changes, this would 
be a bad time. However, if you'd like to help out in the changeover, you
can help out by working on removing all references to the "active" CPU, as
mentioned in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0128u4.txt">whatsnew.txt</a>
file. If you do opt to pitch in here, please coordinate with the rest of
the developers by submitting your intentions ahead of time, to avoid
duplication of effort.
