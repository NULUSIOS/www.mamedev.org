MAME 0.112u3

<p>
A third update to MAME 0.112 is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release page</a>. The biggest change in this release is a significant 
change to the way sound is generated. The previous implementation allowed 
the OS-specific code to control the sound, which ended up having subtle 
impacts on the consistency of the emulation. For example, a user running 
with one sample rate might get different results from a user running at 
a different sample rate. As of this release, the OS-specific code is no 
longer in control of sound generation at all. Instead, the core emulator 
decides how much sound to generate and hands it over 50 times/second to 
the OS layer. As a result, this change impacts not only the internals of 
the sound system, but also requires us to change the way we stream sound 
in the Windows-specific code (and the SDL code will need to be updated 
as well).

<p>
A side-effect of this change is that it is now very important for the frame 
rate to be as accurate as possible. This means that the behavior of the 
code which throttles MAME down to the proper frame rate is very important. 
Thus, several changes to the way MAME throttles its speed have been implemented. 
Hopefully this will produce more regular frame rates and fewer sound glitches. 
As usual, report any problems to <a href="http://mametesters.org"

In addition to the sound changes, Derrick Renaud has made some changes 
to the way analog inputs are handled. This is all to the good and improves 
the accuracy of the controls, but may introduce a bit of confusion. Be 
sure to read the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0112u3.txt">whatsnew.txt</a> 
file and the updated windows.txt file to see how things work in the new 
world.

Finally, we have some nice additions to the Konami System 573 driver from 
smf, discrete sound in Amazing Maze thanks again to Derrick, and some nice 
Eolith driver improvements. All in all, a nice release, but not for the 
faint of heart if big changes make you nervous!
