<p>
MAME 0.142u4 is now posted to the
<a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Latest Updates</a> page.<br>
This release features a shiny new HLSL post-effects Shader Engine 
(written by Bat Country Entertainment), which allows those using a
Windows OS and a decent video card with proper driver support for Pixel
Shader 3.0 to display many interesting and authentic looking effects.
Also, this release introduces a new toolchain which contains the required
additional headers needed for you to use this new feature.  Obtain these
new packages from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools/">Development Tools</a> page.<br>
