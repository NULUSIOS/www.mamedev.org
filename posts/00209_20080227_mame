<p>
Time for another <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">update 
to MAME 0.123</a>. Read the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0123u3.txt">whatsnew</a>

Also, thanks to Fujix's hard work over at <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAMETesters</a>, they will shortly be 
unveiling a new bug database to track issues in. This will allow for more 
distributed tracking and will hopefully make it easier to sift through 
the piles of bugs going forward.
