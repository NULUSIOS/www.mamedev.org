All Better?

<p>
Since the new site went up last year, I've had scattered reports of various problems.
Yesterday, I think I managed to sort them out. Turns out most of the problems were
caused by an overaggressive filter, which I have now pruned to enable some common
folks to access the site. Things that were previously affected include:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> was unable to view the RSS feed.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bing.com">MSN/Live/Bing</a> was unable to crawl the site (give it time to start showing up).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.blackberry.com">Blackberry</a> devices would get errors trying to access the site.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In addition, I noticed that ZTnet had stopped providing the nameservers for mame.net, so I
switched them over to new ones that point to this site. While I was there I made mamedev.org
the canonical site name, and changed all the aliases to redirect there.
