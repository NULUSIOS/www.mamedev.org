MAME 0.116u2

<p>
A new update to MAME 0.116 is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release page</a>. The big news in this release is of course the decryption 
and booting of Capcom's <a href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=799" 
target="_blank">CPS-III</a> games. A lot of great 
progress has happened on this, but be warned, there is still a good 
deal of work left to complete the emulation. We also have some more <a 
href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=869" target="_blank">Neo-Geo</a> 
updates from Zsolt, a major <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/dooyong.c" 
target="_blank">Dooyong driver</a> update from Vas Crabb, 
and some nice code cleanups from Zsolt and Atari Ace.

There have been a lot of nice updates to drivers over the past couple of 
months, but that also means there may be some regressions lurking. So if 
you see anything amiss, please post a message on the <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAME Testers</a> board lettings us know!
