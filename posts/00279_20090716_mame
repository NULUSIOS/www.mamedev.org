California Extreme 2009 Slides

<p>
As promised at my <a href="http://www.caextreme.org">California Extreme</a>
talk, I've posted <a href="http://mamedev.org/misc/cax2009.pdf">the slides</a>
to the deck so that you have access to all the links and info for reference. 
If you weren't able to attend, feel free to have a look, but keep in mind that 
I tend not to put everything in the slides. This year at least there was a bit 
more show &amp; tell to it, so it should at least make some sense.

Regarding last year's talk, hopefully the organizers will post it relatively
soon (I've seen the video). I never posted the slides to that one because they
are really pretty sparse and not very useful on their own. Once the video is
posted I'll include a link to it and the slides (which you'll need because
they are not captured in the video).

Have fun!
