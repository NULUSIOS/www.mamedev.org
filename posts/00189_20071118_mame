MAME 0.121

<p>
Time for another full release of MAME. Grab it from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. This time around I've done some shuffling to improve 
traffic. The binary releases are being hosted on two mirror sites. Click 
through to them to download the actual binaries. I've also pulled the source 
updates off of the main release page and created a new <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">MAME 
Source Updates</a> page which will hold them when the time comes. 
Hopefully this will keep things running smoothly!
