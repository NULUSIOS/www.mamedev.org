MAME 0.118u3

<p>
A new update to MAME 0.118 is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. This release features mostly internal fixes, notably 
some significant DIP switch cleanups in Taito games from stephh, better 
CD-ROM emulation for the CPS3 driver thanks to Ernesto Corvi, and a long-postponed 
change to the V30 and I8086 CPU cores to give them proper 16-bit data 
busses. Make sure you test affected drivers and report any issues to <a 
href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAME 
Testers</a>.
