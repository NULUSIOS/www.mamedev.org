Passing the Torch

<p>
Due of real life issues and concerns, I've decided it would be best to
step back and give coordination of the project to someone else who can
keep the project moving forward.  So, effective immediately, I am
passing the leadership of the MAME project to the current MESS project
leader, Miodrag Milanovic (Micko).
<br>
I would like to extend a word of thanks to everybody that has
contributed to MAME this year including developers, testers and
individual users alike.  I also would like to assure you all that I
will not be leaving the project and my stepping back is simply to
allow myself a temporary break so that I might concentrate my time on
other issues.
