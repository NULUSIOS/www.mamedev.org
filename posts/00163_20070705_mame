This is the last planned update to version 0.116, so be sure to get your 
bugs reported to <a href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAME 
Testers</a> as soon as possible so that the 0.117 release is solid. 
After the next release is out, there will be some changes coming to the 
input system to move some functionality into the core and add a couple 
of nice extensions as well.
