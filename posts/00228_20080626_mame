MAME 0.125u7

<p>
Time for the weekly MAME update: get MAME 0.125u7 over at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a> page. I anticipate a u8 next week followed shortly 
thereafter with MAME 0.126, so now would be a great time to verify that 
there are no showstoppers in any games you care about!
</p>

<p>
An important note about this release: inclusion of debugging support in 
MAME is no longer optional. That is, you can still disable it (using the 
-nodebug option, or setting 'debug' to 0 in your mame.ini file), but you 
can no longer compile without it. This will give a small-ish performance 
hit (under 5% in most cases) in exchange for always being able to pull 
up the debugger and will reduce the test matrix necessary to verify MAME's 
behavior.
</p>

<p>
Note that due to a slight oversight, the debugger is enabled by default 
in this build, so you may need to explicitly turn it off. This will default 
to off in u8.
