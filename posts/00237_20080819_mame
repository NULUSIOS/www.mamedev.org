MAME 0.127

<p>
After a large amount of internal changes and restructuring, release day 
is finally here. Grab the final MAME 0.127 release from our <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page.
</p>

<p>
This release marks a new "first" in MAME history: the first officially 
supported laserdisc game, Cube Quest, is now up and running. This was definitely 
one of the more obscure and challenging games to emulate, so special kudos 
to Philip Bennett, Joe Magiera, and Warren Ondras for figuring it all out!
