MAME 0.116u3

<p>
Time for another release, <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">get 
it while it's hot</a>. Due to the (Windows-specific) input-related 
issues in the last couple of builds, the input code has been temporarily 
reverted back to what it was in 0.116. These issues have prompted a more 
pervasive cleanup that has been brewing for some time, and which isn't 
ready to distribute just yet.

<p>
In the meantime, this release has the expected collection of <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/cps3.c" 
target="_blank">CPS3</a> updates from Haze, some significant 
improvements to <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/djboy" 
target="_blank">DJ Boy</a> emulation thanks to the return 
of Phil Stroffolino, an improved <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/dkong" 
target="_blank">Donkey Kong</a> driver from couriersud 
with better colors and many other enhancements, and another round of modernizations 
thanks to Zsolt. Have fun!
