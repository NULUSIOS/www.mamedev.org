MAME 0.118

<p>
The latest official release of MAME is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. This release is the first official version with 
the updated input system support. Hopefully most of the issues were dealt 
with during the development cycle, but if you find something not working 
correctly, please report it (and any other bugs) over at <a href="http://mametesters.org" 
target="_blank">MAME Testers</a>.
