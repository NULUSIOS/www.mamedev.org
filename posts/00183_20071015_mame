MAME 0.120

<p>
Come and grab the latest official "stable" build of MAME from 
the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest Release</a> 
page, or from the <a href="http://mame.net/release-mirror.html">ZTNet 
Mirror</a>. As of this release, I am officially producing a 64-bit 
native Windows binary along with the usual 32-bit builds to help encourage 
more testing of the 64-bit native code. For the most part, games run at 
least as well as the 32-bit versions, and some run significantly better 
thanks to the architectural improvements of native 64-bit mode.

<p>
Another notable change with this release is the movement of some core shared 
files in the source tree. A number of files in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/machine">mame/machine</a> 
and <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/video">mame/video</a> 
directories were really more core shared components, and so they have been 
given a new home in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/machine">emu/machine</a> 
and <a href="http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/video">emu/video</a> 
directories.
