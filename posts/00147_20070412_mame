MAME 0.114u1

<p>
After a bit of a breather, there's a new <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">MAME 
update</a> now available. This update features a new Namco 50xx chip 
emulation from Nicola to replace the previous simulation that was done. 
Thanks to Ernesto, Andrew, Guru, and others for the decoding work that 
led to this improvement. A large bunch of new skeleton drivers were added 
by Ville, R. Belmont, and others, though they are all far from working. 
Ville also made some significant improvements to several of the later Konami 
drivers, bringing them closer to playable. And lastly, there's been a substantial 
change to the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/index.php?src=srch.php%3Fpage%3D1%26cpu%3D153%26by%3Dname" 
target="_blank">TMS34010-based games</a> which simplifies 
the logic and improves their accuracy by centralizing the management of 
video updates in the TMS34010 core itself.
