MAME 0.114

<p>
Today sees the release of <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">MAME 
0.114</a>. If you haven't been keeping up with the intermediate releases, 
this release will have some significant changes and improvements. See the 
specifics in the individual posts below, or in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0114.txt">whatsnew 
file for 0.114</a>.
</p>

<p>
The biggest change since 0.113u4 is the addition of a now-working driver 
for <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/vr" target="_blank">Virtua 
Racing</a>, thanks to the efforts of Ernesto and El Semi. In addition 
to this news, Derrick also managed to get full discrete sound emulation 
working for <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/dplay" 
target="_blank">Double Play</a>/<a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/einning" 
target="_blank">Extra Inning</a>, and partial sound 
emulation in <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/bowler" 
target="_blank">Bowling Alley</a> and <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/spcenctr" 
target="_blank">Space Encounters</a>. And as usual a 
few of the major issues and regressions from the 0.114 development cycle 
have been addressed.

<p>
Onward to 0.115!
