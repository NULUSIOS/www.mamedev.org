MAME 0.116u1

<p>
A quick turn of the crank and we have <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">the 
first 'u' release of the 0.117 development cycle</a>. There are a 
couple of significant changes this time that need some good testing. First 
off, Zsolt has taken the plunge and done a full rewrite of the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/neogeo.c" 
target="_blank">Neo Geo driver</a> based on <a href="http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/" 
target="_blank">Charles MacDonald's</a> detailed study 
of the hardware. I'm sure this will be fun and controversial! We also have 
newly-added support for multiple keyboards in the Windows code and a switch 
over to using the raw input APIs, thanks to Andrew Kuruhin. In addition, 
there are a number of nice SH-4 updates from Samuele Zannoli, some more 
progress on <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/matchit2" 
target="_blank">Match It II</a> from Robiza, and a bunch 
of fixes for regressions that seeped into the final 0.116 release.

Remember, <a href="http://mametesters.org" target="_blank">MAME 
Testers</a> is your friend. We can't fix the bugs if we don't know 
about them!
