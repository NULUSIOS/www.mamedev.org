MAME 0.129u6

<p>
Ok, we are on the home stretch now. Thanks to Phil Bennett, most of the major problems of
the last few versions have been cleaned up. This should be the last update before we
release 0.130, so make sure you get your bug reports into <a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis" target="blank">MAMETesters</a>
as soon as you can to help ensure this is a good release!
