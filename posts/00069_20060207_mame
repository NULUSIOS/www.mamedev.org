Lost submissions

<p>
If you've sent any submissions to mamedev.com in the last week, they are 
likely floating in the ether somewhere. You should switch to sending them 
to mamedev.org instead. I've fixed the problem that caused the .com-sent 
ones to not get forwarded, but .org is the way to go in the future.
