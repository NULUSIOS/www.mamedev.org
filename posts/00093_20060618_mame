MAME 0.106u6

<p>
Looks like we're in for a long string of u releases this time around. The 
6th update for this cycle is <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">now 
available</a>. Note that the code to run the rendering on a separate 
thread is disabled for the time being until after the core renderer and 
other bits get stabilized. There's a reason the last build was considered 
experimental!
