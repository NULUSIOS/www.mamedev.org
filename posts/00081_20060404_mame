MAME 0.105

<p>
At long last, <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">MAME 
0.105 has been released</a>. As an experiment, I am hosting both 
source and binaries here until <a href="http://mame.net">mame.net</a> 
is updated. Please read the notice about how the official binaries are 
no longer UPX-compressed and don't freak out when the extracted binary 
is much larger than you are used to.
