New ROMs and Wiki Content

<p>
Hey, what do you know, a post that isn't about a MAME release!
</p>

<p>
I've got some exciting news. In addition to allowing the free distribution 
of <a title="Teeter Torture ROMs" href="http://mamedev.org/roms/teetert">Teeter 
Torture</a> from this site, H. R. Kauffman, the president of Xidy, 
Inc. (formerly Exidy), has agreed to allow us to distribute many of the 
older released Exidy games here as well! So, over the next few weeks, we 
will be featuring many games from the Exidy lineup here on the site. The 
first of these is the classic game <a title="Exidy Circus ROMs" 
href="http://mamedev.org/roms/circus">Circus</a>, released 
in 1977.
</p>

<p>
Look for more games to appear shortly. Ultimately, it would be awesome 
if some of the bigger companies would recognize the historical significance 
of some of their older titles and allow them to be enjoyed by a wider audience 
in this manner.
</p>

<p>
The second bit of news is that there have been some great additions to 
the <a title="MAME developer wiki" href="http://mamedev.org/devwiki">developer 
wiki</a> since it was first created. I wanted to highlight a few 
of the updates:<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>Andrew Gardner has put up links to various technical articles 
and other details that have appeared in blogs and articles in the past, 
and Mike Ellery has posted an article on DIP switches in the <a title="How 
MAME Works" href="http://www.mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php?title=How_MAME_Works">How 
MAME Works</a> section<br/>
 </li><br/>
	<li>Reip, Phil Bennett, and I have put up "to-do" 
lists on the <a title="Developer WIPs" href="http://www.mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php?title=Developer_WIPs">Developer 
WIP</a> page. I find this a great location to jot down random ideas 
I have; hopefully other devs will find it equally useful.<br/>
 </li><br/>
	<li>MooglyGuy has been doing a very cool job of wiki-fying the whatsnew.txt 
files from earlier MAME versions with annotations and links to <a title="MAWS" 
href="http://mameworld.net/maws" target="_blank">MAWS</a> 
for games referenced. See the new <a title="Previous MAME Versions" 
href="http://www.mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php?title=Previous_MAME_Versions">Previous 
MAME</a> Versions section to see what has been done so far.<br/>
 </li><br/>
	<li>I have also started the process of migrating the MAME FAQ and 
updating the text to be more accurate to the current state of the project. 
See the current WIP version in the new <a title="MAME FAQ" 
href="http://www.mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions">Frequently 
Asked Questions</a> section of the wiki.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Overall, some great content on the wiki so far! You can keep an eye on 
the <a title="Recent changes" href="http://www.mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges">Recent 
Changes</a> page to see what's going on in finer detail, if you're 
interested. You can even keep an <a title="RSS feed for recent 
changes" href="http://www.mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;feed=rss">RSS 
feed</a> for that page if you really want to stay on top of things!
