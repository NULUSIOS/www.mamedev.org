MAME 0.127u8

<p>
Ok, so I lied. We're not quite ready for 0.128 without a little more testing, 
so <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">here we have 
0.127u8</a>. If you are playing with this version, make sure the 
Neo-Geo and Sega C2 drivers are working as expected, and report bugs as 
usual to <a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis" target="_blank">MAMETesters</a>.
