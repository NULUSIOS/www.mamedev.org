MAME 0.108u2

<p>
A new release of MAME is <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">now 
available</a>. If you want to play with multithreading again, it 
is now a runtime option you can control with a command line option. Also, 
probably the most explicit arcade game to date has been added, and a bunch 
of Lethal Enforcers clones have been unearthed.
