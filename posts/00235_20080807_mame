MAME 0.126u4

<p>
Get it while it's hot over on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a> page. It's worth pointing out that the cheat system is 
re-enabled with this version, but it is in read-only mode (that is, it 
can read new-format cheats but has no tools to generate new ones yet). 
Until there is a converted database, the code is still very much in the 
early test phase, so don't get too excited just yet. With luck, we'll have 
cheats working again in an update or two.
