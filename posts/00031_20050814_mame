MAME 0.99u2

<p>
The latest source update is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.com/source.html">Latest 
Releases</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Note that as of this release, we've decided to allow video-based gambling 
games to be included with MAME. As a result, a number of new drivers have 
been added that were previously removed or which were originally developed 
for <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/agemame/">AGEMAME</a>.
