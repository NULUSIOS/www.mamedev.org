MAME Build Tools

<p>
1. Download <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/buildtools/releases/download/1.0/install.exe">install.exe</a> and complete installation. It will take some time to pull up-to-date code<br/>
2. Start <b>buildtools.bat</b> (plain cmd) or <b>cmder.exe</b> (fancy console) from installed folder (by default it is C:\buildtools)<br/>
3. From time to time run <b>update</b> in order to update tools <br/>
4. Download MAME source<br/>
<br/>
<b>git clone https://github.com/mamedev/mame.git</b><br/>
Console emulator is based on Cmder, with some small changes in scripts.<br/>
<br/>
For those needed offline download <br/>
Download from here : <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/buildtools/releases/download/1.1/buildtools.7z">buildtools.7z</a><br/>
<br/>
For those already having GIT installed<br/>
<b>git clone https://github.com/mamedev/buildtools</b> <br/>
This works same as when installed with installer.<br/>
