MAME is going open source

<p>
After lot of years being under MAME own license (prohibiting any commercial use) and therefore not open source, we are 
finally moving towards becoming officially open source project. Idea is to keep core under BSD3 license and rest is up to
developers that created code (drivers and devices emulation). (options are BSD3, LGPL2 or GPL2)</p>

<p>Hopefully this will bring more new developers to MAME project and give more life to project itself.</p>

<p>Please note that MAME trademark is still valid the "MAME" name and MAME logo may not be used without first obtaining permission of the trademark holder.</p>
