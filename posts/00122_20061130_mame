MAME 0.110u4

<p>
A new MAME update is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">releases 
page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Edit: Looks like a stray whatsnew.txt file which I removed from my svn 
tree got included in the diff. If you ignore that part of the diff, it 
works fine. I've also updated the file on the server to remove that part 
of the diff.
