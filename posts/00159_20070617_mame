Updated Windows Build Tools Now Available

<p>
Those of you who regularly build their own MAME binaries on Windows will 
want to head over to the <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools">Development 
Tools</a> page and follow the directions there to grab the latest 
set of tools. This set of tools contains the latest officially released <a 
href="http://www.mingw.org/" target="_blank">mingw</a> 
toolset, along with a set of patched files that fixes the problems they 
have been having under Vista. This means that you can now build MAME on 
a Vista machine just like on any other machine â€” no more hacks required 
(in fact, if you have the existing workarounds enabled, you need to remove 
them; in particular the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX environment variable should be 
eliminated).
</p>

<p>
A side effect of this upgrade is that the official base compiler for the 
Windows builds is now gcc 3.4.5 instead of 3.4.2. This isn't a big change, 
but it is worth noting. Hopefully the mingw folks will eventually get around 
to releasing a 4.x build of gcc sometime in the not-too-distant future, 
but I'm not holding my breath. A toolchain that supports 64-bit compilation 
under Windows would also be nice, but let's not get carried away here.

Finally, the pre-packaged toolset now contains the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" 
target="_blank">SDL</a> headers and libraries, so you 
can build <a href="http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163" 
target="_blank">SDLMAME</a> for Windows out of the box.
