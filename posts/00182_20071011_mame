MAME 0.119u4

<p>
Time for a new update; grab it from the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. A number of new games and clones are enabled in 
this release, thanks to Haze and Luca Elia (and all those who helped dump 
the games). We also have support for Player's Edge Plus Double Bonus Poker, 
contributed by new contributor <a href="http://stolistic.blogspot.com/" 
target="_blank">Jim Stolis</a>, who has been documenting 
his progress on his <a href="http://stolistic.blogspot.com/" 
target="_blank">blog</a>. This release also contains 
some updates to the multithreaded 3dfx support, hopefully making it scale 
better above 2 CPUs and simplifying the implementation for those working 
on other ports.
