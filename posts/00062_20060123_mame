Welcome to mamedev.org!

<p>
After experiencing too many bandwidth issues with my previous host, I've 
decided to move the MAMEDev site over to a new hosting service. The content 
should be identical for the moment, though I am hoping to expand it in 
the future. If you experience any strangeness or problems, feel free to 
<a href="http://mamedev.org/contact.html?webmaster">drop 
me a line</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've decided that MAMEDev is more of an 'org' than a 'com', so I'm trying 
to encourage the use of mamedev.org as the primary site name. For the moment, 
mamedev.com still points to the old site, though I will be redirecting 
that shortly to point here as well.
