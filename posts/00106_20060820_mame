MAME 0.108

<p>
A new full release of MAME is <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">now 
available</a>. Beginning with this release, an official debug binary 
is being posted so that folks who wish to use MAME for examining what's 
going on in the code can do so without needing to set up for compiling 
MAME itself.
