MAME 0.126u3

<p>
Time for a massive update: <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">MAME 
0.126u3</a>. Due to a change internally with the way memory regions 
are handled, a large percentage of all files in the project needed to be 
updated.
</p>

<p>
There's been a regression test against the change already, so we should 
be beyond crashing problems. But it is possible that some games may be 
missing sound due to mismatched sound regions. If you hear anything funky, 
please report it to <a href="http://mametesters.org/mantis" 
target="_blank">MAMETesters</a> so that we can get the 
problems ironed out in time for u4.
