MAME 0.112u1

<p>
Now available for download is the <a title="Latest Release" 
href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">first update to MAME 
0.112</a>. And this one's a big one. The most obvious impact is that 
the source code tree has been significantly reorganized. A number of changes 
that have been made over the past couple of years have resulted in a somewhat 
more modular codebase, and now is a good time to organize things accordingly. 
Unfortunately, due to the file movement, a diff of this release would probably 
be twice the size of the raw code, so you'll have to download the full 
set of sources.

If you are a developer, it is very important that you update to this release, 
as patches against 0.112 and earlier won't apply properly, and there is 
no guarantee that they will be accepted.

Other exciting news for this release includes actual emulation of the Namco 
54xx sound chip, which turns out to be a Fujitsu MB8844 microcontroller 
with embedded ROM. This allows the removal of samples from <strong>Galaga</strong>, 
<strong>Bosconian</strong>, and <strong>Xevious</strong>, 
among others. We also have some nice sound core improvements from the hoot 
development team, some nice new input port support, a few new CPS2 keys, 
and a bunch of fixes for subtly (and not-so-subtly) broken drivers due 
to the Z80 change late in the 0.111 dev cycle. Have fun!
