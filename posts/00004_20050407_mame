Welcome!

<p>
Welcome to the official MAME development team site. This site is intended 
to be the official communications channel for the development team.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, this site is in "beta" mode in order to get feedback 
on the <a href="http://mamedev.com/license.html">new license</a> 
and the other info that appears on the left-hand side. Note that most of 
the text from the old license didn't really belong in a license, and is 
now a separate document called <a href="http://mamedev.com/about.html">About 
MAME</a>. If you have feedback, please use the <a href="http://mamedev.com/contact.html?webmaster">contact 
form</a> to send it to the appropriate place.
</p>

<p>
What you will find here:<ul><li>announcements of official releases</li><li>links 
to the official source code distribution</li><li>information 
on the MAME license and trademark</li><li>links to useful MAME-related 
sites</li><li>a means of contacting the team and some of the 
individual developers</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
What you will not find here:<ul><li>binary distributions of 
MAME</li><li>message boards</li><li>chat rooms</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
For that kind of stuff, go to <a href="http://www.mame.net">mame.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this site will help end some of the confusion over how to contact 
the team and where the official releases come from.
