<p>
Get it while it's hot from: <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'll also mention there are a couple of new interesting wiki articles: 
one from R. Belmont on <a href="http://mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php/Tilemaps">how 
tilemaps work</a>, and one from Mr. Do! on <a href="http://mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php/LAY_File_Basics_-_Part_I">how 
to write .lay files</a> for the artwork system. If anyone would 
like wiki access to write an article, use the <a href="http://mamedev.org/contact.html">contact 
form</a> to send a proposal and request to the team. If you haven't 
checked out the <a href="http://mamedev.org/devwiki">wiki</a> 
in a while, you may find there's a lot more content there than there used 
to be!
