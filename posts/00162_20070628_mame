MAME 0.116u3 Redux

<p>
Oops, looks like my build script was broken by the recent change in object 
paths, and thus it did not catch a compilation error in the original 0.116u3 
update. A new version of the diff is <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">now 
available</a> (same name as the original). If you need to unapply 
the original (via patch -R), you can still download the busted one <a 
href="http://mamedev.org/updates/0116u3_diff-old.zip">here</a>.
