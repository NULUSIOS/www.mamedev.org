MAME 0.106u3

<p>
A <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">new update</a> 
is now available. Please take special note of the warnings this time:
</p>

<p>
WARNING: As of this build, the new rendering system is enabled by default. 
The primary focus at this point is compatibility, not performance. Compared 
to the old -ddraw system, it will appear slower when fully unthrottled 
because there is not a good mechanism to skip the render if the graphics 
hardware is still busy like we used to do. If you have any trouble getting 
a correct display or if you get warning messages printed out when starting 
MAME, please post about them on <a href="http://mametesters.org">http://mametesters.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
SECONDARY WARNING: The command line and INI parsing code was rewritten. 
If you notice any problems with handling of parameters in either case, 
please report the bugs on <a>http://mametesters.org</a>.
</p>
