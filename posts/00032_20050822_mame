<p>
A big update this time, available on the <a href="http://mamedev.com/source.html">Latest 
Release</a> page (note that the link to the ZIP file points offsite 
to relieve bandwidth).

<p>

junk in the front-end code, a number of non-essential command line options 
have been removed. A few other lightly controversial changes have been 
made as well. Let the whinging commence.
