MAME 0.118u2

<p>
A new update to the 0.118 release is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. Notable changes this time around include some nice 
DIP switch updates from stephh and a new command-line control to specify 
the emulation playback speed. This will hopefully be a useful tweak for 
those of you who have monitors stuck at 60Hz and who are experiencing audio 
issues as a result.
