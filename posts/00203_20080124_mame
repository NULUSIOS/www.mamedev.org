MAME 0.122u7

<p>
Time for <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">another 
MAME update</a>. Another dozen bugs squashed and bunch more fixes/improvements, 
spelled out in excruciating detail in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates/whatsnew_0122u7.txt">whatsnew.txt</a>.
</p>

<p>
And no, I don't think we'll go up to 11, but there's at least one more 
update expected before 0.123 is ready.
