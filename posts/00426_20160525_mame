MAME 0.174

<p>We're pleased to announce the release of MAME 0.174!</p>
  
<p>This new release includes some very exciting newly playable machines, including the Tiger Game.com handheld and the ultra-rare Seibu Kaihatsu title, Metal Freezer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Apple 2 driver now supports the Mockingboard 4C card, and the regressions in the IT Eagle (Golden Tee Fore) driver's colors from the previous release have been fixed.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there should be better support for DirectInput 8 on Windows, including supporting older game controllers which previously only worked using the DirectInput 7 module. If you still have a controller which DirectInput 8 does not support that you regularly use, please contact us so that we know what controllers still do not work.</p>
