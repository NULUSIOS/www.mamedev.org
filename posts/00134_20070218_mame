MAME 0.112u2

<p>
We're back to regular-sized 'u' updates again with this release. Some highlights 
this time around include the final death of XOR files for CPS2 games, filtering 
on the new Namco 54xx sound output, more improvements to the Cidelsa driver, 
and more infrastructure for supporting the laserdisc games. Grab the diff
