0.113u2</a>. Please note that there is an updated uismall.png file

the existing design.

<p>
Other improvements in this release include work from Zsolt Vasvari to push 
more drivers over to the updated (and more accurate) video timing routines, 
some nice <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/ultratnk" 
target="_blank">Ultra Tank</a> and <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/sprint4" 
target="_blank">Sprint 4</a> improvements from Stefan 
Jokisch, the first multi-core aware driver (gaelco3d), and a bunch of internal 
changes that moves more code into the core so that each port of MAME doesn't 
need to copy and paste nearly identical code.
