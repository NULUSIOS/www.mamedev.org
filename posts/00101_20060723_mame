MAME 0.107

<p>
At long last, a <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">"final" 
MAME release</a>. This is the first full release with the new renderer. 
If you're new to the way things work now, please read the newvideo.txt 
in the docs folder on the new release to get a sense for how you should 
configure your video.
</p>

<p>
If you rely heavily on a frontend, you might want to wait on updating this 
release until you are sure your frontend can handle configuring things 
with the new options.
