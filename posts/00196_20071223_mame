MAME 0.122u1

<p>
As a little pre-Christmas treat, we have the first update to MAME 0.122 
posted at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">Source 
Updates</a> page. The big news here is a working driver for the upright 
<a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/buggyb1" target="_blank">Buggy 
Boy</a>, thanks to Philip Bennett. Haze and Dox have been busy cleaning 
up the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/afega.c" 
target="_blank">afega</a> and <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/nmk16.c" 
target="_blank">nmk16</a> drivers, and as a result a 
large number of previously non-working games are now working. In addition 
to the Buggy Boy work, Philip also submitted a nice fix to the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/driverinfo/namcona1.c" 
target="_blank">Namco NA1</a> sound which improves the 
results substantially.

Happy holidays!
