MAME 0.113u3

<p>
A new release of MAME is now available on the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release page</a>. This release features a number of significant updates, 
including full MC8123 emulation from Nicola, allowing a few thought-to-be-lost-forever 
Sega games to be emulated at last. Haze also incorporated a prelminary 
version of his Megadrive code to get the <a href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=704" 
target="_blank">Sega System E</a> games up and running. 
Ville corrected a few bad bugs in the SHARC core, curing a number of issues 
in the Konami and <a href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=713" 
target="_blank">Sega Model 2</a> drivers. Ernesto submitted 
a WIP version of the Model 2 TGP (MB86233) DSP core. Derrick added proper 
sound to <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/sprint4" target="_blank">Sprint 
4</a>. Zsolt rewrote the vic dual driver with proper video timing, 
along with some additional fixes and updates to video timing in other drivers. 
And a sudden influx of Korean and Chinese games has appeared, with a bunch 
of new skeleton drivers and a couple of new working games.

All in all, a lot of stuff is happening!!
