MAME 0.99u4 removal

<p>
I have <a href="http://mamedev.com/source.html">removed 
the 0.99u4 update</a> due to a request from <a href="http://www.arika.co.jp">Arika</a>. 
The next update (u5) will be a diff from 0.99u3. If you already patched 
your source to u4, you will need to either reverse the patch (patch -p0 
-R
