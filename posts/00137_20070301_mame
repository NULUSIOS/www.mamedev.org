MAME 0.112u4

<p>
Today we have a new update to MAME 0.112. You can grab the diff file from 
the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest Release</a> 
page. The sound changes have mostly settled now and this build should be 
a good one to test with. In fact, it would be great to get feedback on 
how sound and throttling are working across a number of systems before 
we move to a 0.113 release, which should follow soon. Please give it a 
try and report your bugs to <a title="MAME Testers" href="http://mametesters.org"

Other significant improvements this time around include some more input 
port fixes from Derrick; discrete sound in <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/checkmat" 
target="_blank">Checkmate</a>, again from Derrick; support 
for the T5182 sound MCU from Nicola, Ernesto, and Lord Nightmare, giving 
sound in <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/darkmist" 
target="_blank">The Lost Castle in Darkmist</a>, <a 
href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/mustache" target="_blank">Mustache 
Boy</a>, and <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/set/panicr" 
target="_blank">Panic Road</a>; and tweaks to many sound 
cores to make them generate audio at their native frequency. Note that 
this latter change may have some negative performance impact, but I didn't 
see anything too significant in limited testing.
