MAME 0.116

<p>
A new full MAME release, both source and official binaries, is now 
available over at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">Latest 
Release</a> page. Since the last update there has been mostly internal 
changes, but I did want to highlight an unexpected and very much welcome 
addition from couriersud: discrete sound emulation in <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/dkong" 
target="_blank">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="http://mameworld.net/maws/set/radarscp" 
target="_blank">Radarscope</a>, and full emulation of 
the Radarscope grid graphics. Wow!
</p>

<p>
And if you are a fan of older games and haven't had time to update since 
0.115, you'll find a lot to like in this release as a number of older drivers 
have been given a good scrubbing over the past month. There are already 
several exciting things brewing for the 0.117 development cycle, so keep 
an eye out for updates, and keep those bug reports flowing at <a href="http://mametesters.org"
