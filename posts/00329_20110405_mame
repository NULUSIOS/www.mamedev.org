Regime Change

<p>
After 6 years of coordinating the MAME project, it is time for me to
step aside and let someone else handle day-to-day management. It has
been an honor to helm the project for so long, and even though I won&rsquo;t
be handling the regular releases and top-level coordination anymore, I
do hope to continue working on modernizing the core, so we are not left
with a half-finished effort.

With this changing of the guard, I am pleased to announce that Angelo Salese
(aka Kale) has volunteered to step in and take over coordination of the
project going forward. Angelo has done a great job improving many drivers
over the years, and I am confident he will be an excellent project leader
going forward.
