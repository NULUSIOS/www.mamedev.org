MAME 0.128u6

<p>
With this <a href="http://mamedev.org/updates.html">latest release</a>,
we have managed to successfully remove the CPU and memory context 
switching. This was not without some amount of effort and churn, so be
on the lookout for bugs. On the plus side, though, I would say that this
release does not appear to suffer from a large number of issues, so don't
be afraid to give it a try!

<p>
The next step is to continue cleaning up from the rather frenzied set of
changes, and to iron out the remaining bugs. I'm hoping to hit 0.129
sometime shortly before the 1st of the year.
