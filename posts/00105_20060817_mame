MAME 0.107u4

<p>
A <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">new release</a> 
is now available. Major changes in this one include new output support 
and new built-in primitives and rendering layouts. I'm hoping to close 
out and release 0.108 shortly, so if there are major outstanding issues 
still lurking, make sure they are logged over at <a href="http://mametesters.org">MAME 
Testers</a>.
