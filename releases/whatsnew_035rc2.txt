Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Added rotary control support to Top Gunner. This works in topgunbl *only* -
  the gun turret cannot be rotated in jackal and topgunr, those games don't
  support the rotary joystick. [Karl Stenerud]

- Incresed the horizontal resolution for NeoGeo to 320. This looks strange with
  some games, but it is definitely the correct value as I verified it on the
  real thing. Games like Puzzle Bobble and Baseball Stars use the extra area,
  while most of the other games draw just two bars in there. If a game looks
  odd, adjust your monitor to send the extra area offscreen. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the slapstic emulation in Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Xybots, Empire Strikes
  Back, Rampart. [Ernesto Corvi, Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed crashes in Demon, added analog controls to Tailgunner, fixed reset bug
  in Space Wars, added glove control to Boxing Bugs, added color to War of the
  Worlds and Boxing Bugs (seems to be wrong compared to Retrocade).
  [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Added scroll to Pinball Action when you push button 4, but I'm not sure it's
  correct. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Simplified the error message when ROMs are missing. It now gives a list of
  all the missing ROMs, it doesn't stop at the first one. [Nicola Salmoria]

- IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: the "safety area" allocated by osd_new_bitmap() must
  now be 16 pixels instead of 8. This is required by the NeoGeo driver.
