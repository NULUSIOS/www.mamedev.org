Source:
-------

- The main binary distribution of MAME is now a completely new win32 console
  port. Some of the benefits are: support for full screen hardware stretching
  (if you have a decent video card), and a much better command line / options
  file parsing (ported from xmame).
  To create the mame.ini configuration file on startup, use the -createconfig
  option. -showusage lists all available options. [Aaron Giles, Bernd Wiebelt]
