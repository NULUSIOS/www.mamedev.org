Note: non volatile ram is now saved to a new directory, NVRAM (instead of
the old HI). You must create that directory manually, otherwise the files
will not be saved.

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Sprite multiplexing support in the Exidy440 games, this fixes Chiller's
  start screen. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed the internal orientation of the Cinematronics games, if you use
  artwork files for those games you'll have tomanually flip them (or
  redownload).


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Improved Capcom Avengers, the wrong colors are caused by the protection.
  [Phil Stroffolino]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added noise generator to the Namco sound emulation. [Takahiro Nogi]


Source:
-------

- Removed *rom_decode and *opcode_decode from struct GameDriver. Decryption
  must now be handled by *driver_init. If opcodes and data are decrypted
  separately, remember to allocate a larger chunk of memory in the ROM
  declaration, decode the opcodes there, and call memory_set_opcode_base()
  to tell the memory system where the opcodes are.
  Note that this new system allows bank switching with encrypted ROMs, which
  wasn't possible before. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed *hiscore_load and *hiscore_save from the GameDriver structure. To
  manage nvram/eeprom/cmos/etc the new *nvram_handler in struct MachineDriver
  must be used. High score save is temporarily disabled. It will be added
  again in a future release using an external .dat file. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The struct GameDriver reorganization is finally complete. Drivers should now
  use the GAME() and GAMEX() macros and not directly the GameDriver structure.
  IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: Note that the clone_of field now is not necessarily
  0 even if the game is not a clone. If clone_of is not 0, to know if the game
  is a clone you have to check (clone_of->flags & NOT_A_DRIVER) is 0.

- Added OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM.

- MachineDriver->frames_per_second is now a float.
