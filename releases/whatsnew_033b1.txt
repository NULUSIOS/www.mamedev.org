0.33 BETA 1 (0.32 doesn't exist to avoid confusion with MAME32)

New ROM sets supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------

Pac-Land [Ernesto Corvi]
Punk Shot [Nicola Salmoria]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles [Alex Pasadyn]
Lock'n'Chase [Zsolt Vasvari]
Side Pocket [Ernesto Corvi]
Zarzon [Dan Boris]
Xain'd Sleena/Solar Warrior [Carlos A. Lozano]
Centipede (rev 1) [Brad Oliver]
Tutankham (Konami). Note that the old version has been renamed "tutankst".
  [Marc Vergoossen]
Nibbler (alternate) Note that I also replaced a bad sound ROM in the previous
  set with the good one in this set. [Nicola Salmoria]
Up'n Down (preliminary - the System 8 driver needs to support rotation, and
  input ports have to be fixed). [Thierry lescot]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed glitches in Gemini Wing and Rygar. [Li Jih Hwa]

- Fade-in/fade-out in Robocop [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed colors in Centipede, including service mode multiplexed color test.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- New Zealand Story [Carlos A. Lozano]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed Atari System 1 games not accepting coins with -fm (actually -fm was
  supposed to be a no-op in this case since emulation of the YM2151 through
  OPL is not supported). You still have to keep sound on, however; disabling
  it will disable coins. Of course you can set the dip switches to Free Play
  and forget about coins.

- Service mode in Centipede and Millipede works. [Brad Oliver]

- Added support for coin counters to some games. [Brad Oliver]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Increased the watchdog period, to avoid unexpected resets in some MCR games.


Source:
-------

- Drivers which dynamically change the palette are no longer required to
  initialize it in convert_color_prom(); they also can avoid initializing the
  color table, if the default layout for it (a 1:1 mapping) fits their needs.
  This is also useful when starting new drivers: you don't need to provide a
  fake palette or prom conversion function, the graphics will be visible
  somehow (but badly, so you had better change the defaults soon ;-) )
  Also, games using PROMs don't need to initialize the colortable if the
  GfxDecodeInfo structure is properly initialized to make the correspondence
  1:1.

- For drivers using the GfxLayer system, dirty rectangle support is partially
  built-in into the core. The OS dependant rendering functions must use
  Machine->dirtylayer to know which portions of the screen need to be
  refreshed. Drivers which use the GfxLayer system no longer need the
  VIDEO_SUPPORTS_DIRTY flag in the MachineDriver structure - it must be turned
  on automatically by the OS dependant code.

- Added support for undocumented Z80 opcodes to the C Z80 core. [Juergen
  Buchmueller]

- Improved speed of the C 68000 core. [Juergen Buchmueller]
  (this is supposed to give a good speed increase, but I don't see any
  appreciable difference on my K6 - Nicola)
