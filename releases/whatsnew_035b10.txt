0.35 BETA 10

Please report any problem you find with the C 68000 core. There are no known
bugs as of now (apart from ball movement in Power Spikes 2), if no new bugs
are found we'll switch back to test the asm core.


New games supported:
--------------------

Shooting Master (not working due to protection) [Nicola Salmoria]

New clones supported:
---------------------

Star Force (encrypted) [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed colors in Birdie King 2. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- "kbmame" multi-button key equivalents for the NeoGeo games. They are only
  available if cheats are enabled. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added menu option to configure the default joystick settings (like the
  default keys), [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Fixed severe slowdowns when 16-bit audio was selected.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The parameters which control tweaked VGA modes can be changed by
  editing mame.cfg, so they can be fine tuned to match each particular video
  card/monitor combination (these are non standard modes so they can't be made
  to work in the same way on all setups). If you want to try that (warning:
  only experienced users should try) make sure to read vgatweak.txt.

- Changed format of the history database. [John Butler]


Source:
-------

- Reorganized the sound subsystems, hopefully I didn't break anything in the
  process. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added support for up to 4 analog controllers (multiple trackballs are NOT
  supported under DOS, but multiple joysticks should work). [Brad Oliver]
