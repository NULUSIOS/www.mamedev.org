0.63

An interim release with many things submitted in the past two months not
included yet.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Subroc-3D, Turbo and Buck Rogers use the artwork to show the LED counters.
  [Stefan Jokish]

- Fixed colors in Dynamic Ski. [Stefan Jokish]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Samples support in Subroc-3D [Dave France]

- Fixed noie frequency in the Exidy games. [Jim Hernandez]

- Preliminary Namco NA sound support. [Phil Stroffolino]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Partially simulated the protection in Birdie Try [Angelo Salese]

- Improved decryption in Quiz F1 1-2 Finish, it's still incomplete though.
  [Angelo Salese]

- Fixed ball position recognition in Golfing Greats. [Olivier Galibert]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New options -nodisclaimer and -nogameinfo to disable startup screens.
  Warnings about incorrect emulation are not disabled. [Aaron Giles]

- Replaced RDTSC timing with QueryPerformanceCounter. This should fix problems
  on SpeedStep notebooks. It seems, however, that it causes even worse problems
  on other machines. Therefore, the old behaviour can be forced with the new
  -rdtsc option. [smf]


Source:
-------

- Now compiled with MinGW 2.0/GCC 3.2. There might be bugs caused by the new
  compiler, let us know.

- All new, much better, YM2413 emulation. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Drum support in YM2608 emulation (check e.g. Tail 2 Nose). [Jarek Burczynski]

- Moved most of the file I/O out of the OS depndant code and into the core.
  Added two new types, mame_file and osd_file, which enforce better type
  checking throughout the system (and prevents confusing the two).
  Instead of calling osd_fopen, osd_fread, osd_fwrite, etc., you now call
  mame_fopen, mame_fread, mame_fwrite, etc. The osd_* calls are reserved
  to the core.
  All the ZIP handling is done in the mame_file functions, so it will be
  inherited by all ports.
  [Aaron Giles]

- [Win32] The diff, snap, cfg, nvram, etc. directories are created
  automatically if they don't exist the first time MAME tries to create a file
  there. [Aaron Giles]

- MIPS III/IV CPU cores. [Aaron Giles]

- ADSP-2115 CPU support. [Aaron Giles]

- TMS32025 CPU core. [Quench]

- Fixed YMF278B emulation. [R.Belmont]
