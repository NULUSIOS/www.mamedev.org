0.35 BETA 6

Note: the CPU cores have been completely torn apart and rearranged in this
release. Don't be surprised if a large number of games donì't work at all.
FOr example, Twin Cobra doesn't boot, and most (all?) of the games using
a 6803 lock up (ctrl-alt-del needed).

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New -stretch option to optionally stretch low resolution games to fill
  the screen. The default is -stretch=off, which is the same behaviour as
  before. -stretch=1024x768 automatically uses the "quadra" mode for horizontal
  games whose resolution is less or equal to 256x256. -stretch=800x600 uses
  the "triple" mode. The -quadra and -triple options are no longer needed and
  have been removed.
  1024x768 will be perfect (for 256x256 games) or almost perfect (for 256x240
  and 256x224 games) without monitor adjustment, so it is indicated for LCD
  displays. However, it is slower than 800x600. 800x600 is faster but the games
  are stretched to resolutions from 768x448 to 768x512, so they don't fill the
  screen and are squashed vertically. Here's the tip: if your monitor is good
  enough, you can use the controls to expand the picture and make it fit
  perfectly in the screen. Note that this tip  applies not only to stretched
  modes, but also to med-res games like Lode Runner (384x256) and the CPS1
  games (384x224). The CPS1 games in particular are unbearably squashed unless
  you adjust the monitor. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New option -volume n to set the startup volume. The volume is an
  attenuation in dB, e. g. "-volume -12" will start with a -12dB attenuation.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- The user interface is rotated by -rol and -ror. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improvements to the YM2610 timers, added an interface for external volume
  control. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Major changes to the whole CPU interface and cores. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] All new, completely rewritten autoframeskip code. [Nicola Salmoria]
