Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Improved the user interface. Use "the key on the left of 1" (tilde on some
  leyboards) to turn on the On Screen Display which lets you change Volume,
  Gamma Correction, Brightess, and independently set the volume levels of the
  sound chips. Tab still brings up the setup menu, which is now asynchronous.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Improved the profiler. It now REQUIRES the Pentium-class RDTSC
  instruction. It will not work on 486s, older Pentiums, and maybe other
  non-Intel CPUs. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- x86 ASM 68000 core. This is a major speed improvement. [Mike Coates, Darren
  Olafson]

- YM3812 and YM3526 software emulator. In the DOS version it is disabled
  because we are using the 100% compatible SoundBlaster OPL chip.
  [Carl-Henrik Skårstedt]

- A begginning for a YM2413 emulator. It pushes data through the YM3812.
  [Paul Leaman, Ernesto Corvi]

- I86 disassembler for the debugger, based on code by Robin Hilliard.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- New functions install_mem_read_handler() and install_mem_write_handler().
  They can be used to install special memory handlers (for example, to trap
  busy loops, or to make small changes to the memory map for games running
  on similar hardware). [Alex Pasadyn]

- New field driver_init in the GameDriver structure. It's an optional function
  which can be used to do some game specific initialization, for example by
  adding memory handlers using the above functions. [Nicola Salmoria]
