Program:
- Support for Green Beret, with partial sound (probably inaccurate).
  Colors are terrible. If you can see what you are doing, it's playable (but
  should it be this fast? I find it very hard)

- Richard Davies and Brad Oliver provided drivers for the so-called "Sega"
  version of Jump Bug (it's actually a bootleg with the protection checks
  removed). The driver supports sound.

- Added joystick support to Vanguard.

- Support for Fantasy on the Nibbler driver. There are several problems, it's
  not playable.

- Thanks to Mike Coates and Peter Clare, Carnival now has colors.

- Stefano Mozzi provided a much better palette for Mario Bros.

- Matthew Hillmer submitted a new palette for Donkey Kong 3. It is not
  intended to be correct, but at least it gets rid of the annoying
  checkerboard effect.

- Tormod Tjaberg provided updated Space Invaders (+clones) drivers which
  support sound. They use samples, derived from Michael Strutts' emulator.

- Support for Fantazia (bootleg version of Moon Cresta)

- Fixed a couple of remaining graphic glitches in the Wizard of Wor driver.

- Various fixes to Burger Time:
  - Fixed CPU clock speed to avoid slowdowns on fourth level.
  - It's much faster on a 486.
  - Sprites no longer "stick" on the screen on a level change.
  - Fixed a bug in high score save.
  DELETE BTIME\BTIME.HI, OTHERWISE THE HIGH SCORE TABLE WILL BE CORRUPTED

- Marc Lafontaine provided a Venture driver. It is partially playable,
  sprites are wrong.
  On startup, keep 1 or 2 pressed to proceed.

Source:
- I wrote some general purpose routines to simplify interface with the AY8910.
  They are in 8910intf.c. See the existing drivers for usage examples.

- To solve the problem with garbled text messages in Time Pilot, modified the
  GameDriver structure replacing letters_start and numbers_start with the
  array charset[36].

- I finally took the time to change Z80.h/M6502.h to make them work together.
  This allowed me to remove some kludges in cpuintrf.c. I also added some new
  functions, which can be used regardless of the CPU type: cpu_getpc(),
  cpu_geticount(), cpu_seticount().

- Fixed a couple of bugs in M6502 BCD arithmetic. One of them was causing the
  pepper counter in Burger Time to behave strangely.

- Brad Oliver modified pokey.c and pokey.h to make them more portable.
