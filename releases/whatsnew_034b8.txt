Neo Geo status
--------------

- All games work, both in arcade and home mode. If you are stuck with a
  copyright message or the coin inputs don't work, delete the .CFG and .HI file
  for that game. This will fix the problem.
  Super Sidekicks 2 controls still stop working after a couple of minutes,
  though. Crossed Swords doesn't let you start a game in arcade mode. It works
  in home mode.

- Sound support is 95% complete. If you experience garbled sound and you get
  NO GOOD DUMP EXISTS errors, this is caused by bad ROMs, not by imperfect
  emulation. There is NO WAY to fix that apart from redumping the bad ROMs.

- If you get a Z80 ERROR message, it means that the sound program ROM is bad.
  Run the game without sound.

- A few games have graphics glitches which are not easily fixed.

- "ROM length mismatch" errors. If you get these, you are just using ROMs
  larger than the ones MAME expects. This is not a fatal error and the game
  will still run fine (provided the ROMs are good, of course). You can "fix"
  the ROMs yourself just by removing the second half of the file.
  Note that the sizes used by MAME are sort of arbitrary. In many cases it is
  difficult to know for sure which size the ROMs are really supposed to be, so
  we decided to consistently use the smallest possible files. The real ROMs
  *might* be larger than that, but the extra space is not used by the game -
  it is either all FF, or contains a verbatim copy of the first half.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Better colors in Scion (still not accurate) [Dick Millikan]

- Added artwork support to Lunar Lander. [Cristopher Kirmse]

- Added artwork support to Asteroid Deluxe. [Peter Hirschberg, Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Background light support in Discs of Tron. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Fixed mooncrgx. [Barry Rodewald]

- High resolution sprites in Blasteroids. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rooms in Intrepid are now properly hidden until you enter them. Also fixed
  the bridges in Round Up. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed flickering sprites in SSI. [Andrew Prime]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Penguin-Kun Wars. [Roberto Fresca]

- Cloak and Dagger, Frenzy, Future Spy, Cop 01. [Dave W.]

- Exciting Soccer. [Jarek Parchanski]

  [Howie Cohen]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Improved the Pokey emulation. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Support for stereo output. This is implelemented in the YM2610 and in
  Tatsuyuki's YM2151. It can be used by other games, for example the Atari
  System 2 games (Paper Boy etc.) have two Pokeys, one per channel.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bass track in Do Run Run. [Jim Hernandez]

- Partial sound in Satan of Saturn. [Nicola Salmoria]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Chelnov is now playable! Plus many other fixes to the driver including
  slowdowns in Karnov. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Stereo sound support. It is a little slower than mono, to turn it off
  use -nostereo. Stereo is enabled only for YM2610 and YM2151 games. The others
  always use mono.

- [DOS] New -listinfo command to give details on all of the supported games.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Several changes to the cheat system, you'll have to download a new cheat
  database if you want to use it. [Stephane Humbert]

- [DOS] Now using a new beta version of the SEAL audio library which further
  improves the dynamic range. You'll notice louder and better balanced sound
  in many games. Let me know about games with bad balance. [Nicola Salmoria]
