Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Alongside the AND key sequences introduced in the previous beta, it is now
  possible to have OR and NOT sequences.
  For recording OR key/joy sequences in the key/joy setup menu simply press
  UI_SELECT (usually ENTER) after the first recorded sequence. Don't press
  any UI_UP/UI_DOWN/UI_CANCEL keys beetwen the two sequences.
  To insert a NOT key/joy simply press it two times.
  The first obvious use for this is to wire button 1 to both the joystick and
  mouse button. [Andrea Mazzoleni]
