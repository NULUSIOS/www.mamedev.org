These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:

- In Mario Bros., the screen bounces when you hit POW. [Brad Oliver]

- Improved Slap Fight. [Christoff Feldtmann]

- Accurate colors in Money Money and Jack Rabbit. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Enemies in TNZS are now visible, using the gfx ROMs from a new set (which is
  not supported yet). [Chris Moore]

These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Sound in Gladiator. [Steve Ellenoff]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Pinball Action. [Dani Portillo]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- The original Elevator Action now works, using the 68705 mcu ROM which was
  missing. Since there is one additional CPU to emulate, it is slower than the
  bootleg version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced Front Line with the complete set containing the 68705 code. It
  still doesn't work though. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced Golden Star with the original, encrypted set. [Mirko Buffoni]

- Improvements to the System 8 driver. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the NOT instruction of the 68000 core. [Mike Coates]

- You can proceed from the "press OK to continue" screen by pushing left then
  right. You can also immediately quit by pressing ESC. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- Moved the Sega encryption code used by Flicky, Future Spy, and many others,
  to machine/segacrpt.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added memory_region_length field to the RunningMachine structure. This could
  be useful for drivers which handle several games on similar hardware.
