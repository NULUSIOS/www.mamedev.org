0.37 BETA 6


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Several fixes and improvements to the Taito L games (sound, priorities,
  speed). [Nicola Salmoria, Jarek Burczynski]

- I hope you didn't throw away unused PROMs from your archives.


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Instead of the internal game name, you can use on the command line
  the .zip file name, it can also include path, so for example
  MAME G:\MyBoards\pacman.zip
  will be equivalent to
  MAME pacman -rompath G:\MyBoards
  [David Widel]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] The makefile now uses rm instead of deltree. If you don't have rm you
  can find it here: http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/gnuish/gnufut21.zip

- TMS5110 emulator, used by Bagman. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Several changes to have the debugger run in the game screen under DOS.
  The debugger display is now entirely rendered in the core using a standard
  bitmap, instead of relying on the OS dependant code to simulate a character
  mapped display.
  Changes affecting porters are:
  osd_set_display() removed
  osd_set_screen_size() removed
  osd_screen_update() removed
  osd_wait_keypress() removed
  osd_debugger_focus() added
  osd_dbg.h removed
  osd_update_video_and_audio() has extra debug_bitmap argument
  osd_allocate_colors() has parameters for the debugger palette
  mamedbg.c no longer requires clock_t and clock()
  It's entirely up to the OS dependant code what to do with the game and debug
  bitmaps. They can be shown one at a time (giving the user a means to switch
  between them), or in two separate windows. osd_debugger_focus() is used to
  request that one of the two bitmaps be made visible to the user.
  Under DOS, you can switch at any time between the game and debugger display
  by pressing F5.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Removed osd_poll_joysticks(). Ports requiring polling of the joystick can do
  so in osd_update_video_and_audio().

- True HD6309 emulation (instead of using the M6809). [Tim Lindner].
