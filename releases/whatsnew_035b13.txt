Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Enabled again the -triplebuffer option, and triple buffering is
  disabled by default. Remember that -triplebuffer disables -vsync, so if
  you absolutely want to use -vsync in VESA modes, don't use -triplebuffer.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved VLM5030 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Fixed a couple of bugs in the 68000 emulation (both asm and C). They affected
  Power Spikes 2 and F1 Dream. [Mike Coates]

- Improved uPD7759 ADPCM decode. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] -stretch 1024x768 can be used with Sichuan II and Golden Star.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Moved mixer control out of streams.c and into the new mixer.c. Now the On
  Screen Display can be used to change the volume of any channel, not just ones
  handled by streams.c. The configuration is also saved on exit and is
  automatically reloaded the next time you start the game. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- The zlib library is required to build MAME, it can be downloaded from
  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/.

- PNG save support. save_screen_snapshot() may be called by osd_save_snapshot()
  to save a standardized shot. Under DOS, .png files go go to the SNAP
  directory. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Mike Haaland]

- struct GameSample no longer has a volume field (since it is not stored in .wav
  files), to replace that struct Samplesinterface has an additional volume field
  which affects all samples played. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced osd_adjust_sample() with osd_set_sample_freq() and
  osd_set_sample_volume(), and the OSD_PAN_xxx macros with MIXER_PAN_xxx.
