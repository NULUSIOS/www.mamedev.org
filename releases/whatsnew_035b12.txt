These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:

  screen when you insert a coin. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Block Block title screen. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the spider gfx, and sky color, in Rainbow Islands. [Mike Coates]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Major improvements to Atari sound (e.g. speech in Toobin') [Aaron Giles]

- Sound in Rainbow Islands. [Mike Coates]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Hippodrome, which is now working 100%.
  [Byan McPhail]

- Drastically reduced load times of the larger NeoGeo games. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Boss order in Super Real Darwin should be correct. [José Miguel Morales
  Farreras]

- Rainbow Islands is playable (using the C-Chip dump from Jumping).
  [Mike Coates]

- Memory card support in the NeoGeo driver. Card data is saved to the MEMCARD
  directory (you have to create it). Use the TAB menu to access the memory card
  options. [Fabrice Martinez]

- Fixed F1 Dream protection workaround (note that the game still doesn't work
  correctly with the 68000 C core). [Mike Coates]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] All flickering problems with triple buffering should now be solved, so
  it's now always ON. Let me know if you have problems with it, and I'll add
  back an option to disable it. vsync and waitvsync are automatically disabled,
  so you can leave them enabled - they will only be used in tweaked VGA modes
  or if your video card doesn't have enough RAM to do triple buffering.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- OSD_FILETYPE_MEMCARD for memory cards. [Fabrice Martinez]
