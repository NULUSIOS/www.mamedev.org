Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Added a workaround for the slow PC keyboard interface. This makes it
  easier to accomplish special moves that require two or three keys pressed at
  the same time, but delays response by at least one frame.
  The change doesn't affect josyticks and keypads connected through the game
  or USB ports. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------
