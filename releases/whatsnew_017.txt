Program:
- Various fixes to Green Beret:
  - Thanks to Paul Swan, it now has 100% accurate colors.
  - Dip switches didn't work, fixed.
  - Support for Rush'n Attack (the US version)
  - I've been told that it actually was too fast, so now it runs slower.
    Let me know how accurate it is.

- Fabrice Frances submitted a massive contribution: an 8086 CPU emulator, and
  drivers for Q*Bert and Mad Planets. They run quite slowly on my 486/100
  (~25 fps) but are playable. Q*Bert has sound too (with samples).
