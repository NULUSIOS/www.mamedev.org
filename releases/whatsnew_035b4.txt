Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- It seems that the Fatal Fury 2 protection was still causing some problems in
  later levels. It should now be completely worked around. NOTE: YOU MUST
  DELETE FATFURY2.HI OR THE GAME WILL MALFUNCTION AFTER THE FIRST BONUS ROUND.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New -quadra and -triple video options. They are slower than the
  others, but provide interesting features. With -quadra the screen is
  quadrupled horizontally and tripled vertically, so a 256x256 game fits
  perfectly in a 1024x768 screen. -triple triples horizontally and doubles
  vertically, so it's perfect for Moon Patrol. [ole00@usa.net]

- Improved palette compression with color fades. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved the YM2610 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled using Allegro 3.11. Unfortunately, contrary to what I
  had been promised, allegro.h provided with the library still fails to
  compile with MAME, so a fixed one is included.
