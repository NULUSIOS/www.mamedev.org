Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Adjusted the autoframeskip code, to make it increase frameskip a little
  faster, but not as fast as it was before the previous change. Let's see how
  this performs. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for gzipped (NOT zipped) cheat files. Uncompressed files still work.
  [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Source:
-------

- Merged the flags and orientation fields of struct GameDriver.

- Removed prom_memory_region from struct GameDriver. The PROM memory region is
  now specified directly in the ROM declaration, with
  ROM_REGIONX( length, REGION_PROMS )
  Similarly, REGION_GFX1..8 are defined for gfx decoding, but drivers have not
  been updated to use them. See drivers/namcos86.c for the only example.

- Removed samplenames from stuct GameDriver. It is now in struct
  SamplesInterface, and some drivers load the samples directly without using
  that structure. Due to this change, -listsamples and -verifysamples, and the
  samples information in -listinfo, are no longer available. Actually, samples
  might not be working at all - I haven't tested them. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed base and size from struct MemoryReadAddress, use MemoryWriteAddress
  to store the pointers. Several drivers had the bad habit of using
  MemoryReadAddress to initialize those variables, hopefully I haven't broken
  any while updating them. [Nicola Salmoria]
