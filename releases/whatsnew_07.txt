Program:
- Support for:
  Super Cobra (version running on a modified Scramble board)
  Amidar US version
  Crazy Climber Japanese version
  Pooyan (wrong colors, no sound)
  Phoenix/Pleiades (no sound)

- Scramble has 100% correct colors. The same palette is used by Super Cobra,
  but it doesn't look right.

- Gorf and Robby Roto boot but don't work.

- Added some support for Moon Quasar, but it doesn't work. Since the ROMs are
  encrypted, I don't know if this is due to wrong decryption, bad ROM, or
  wrong driver (I'm using the Moon Cresta one). I think that either MQ3 (which
  maps at 1000-17ff) is bad, or it uses a different encryption.
