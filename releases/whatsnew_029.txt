IMPORTANT: CONFIGURATION AND HIGH SCORE SAVE FILES HAVE BEEN MOVED. MAKE
SURE YOU MOVE THE OLD ONES TO THE NEW DIRECTORIES "CFG" AND "HI". This will
be done automatically by the provided batch file mov.bat, but PLEASE read
on for details.

NOTE: Bubble Bobble doesn't work in this release. We are aware of that. Use
Bobble Bobble or Super Bobble Bobble instead, they work much better than
Bubble Bobble ever did.

- accurate colors in

  Donkey Kong Jr.
  Congo Bongo
  Phoenix
  10 Yard Fight
  Moon Patrol

  Mario Bros.
  Super Basketball
  Seicross
  1943
  Donkey Kong 3 (well, not really)

  [Tim Lindquist, Nicola Salmoria]

- accurate colors in Bagman and Super Bagman
  [Tim Lindquist, Jarek Burczynski]

- accurate colors in Naughty Boy (probably) [Virtu-Al, Nicola Salmoria]

- Minor fix to Donkey Kong colors (black was dark blue). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Clouds in Time Pilot are correct. [Edward Massey]

- Lives left are correctly displayed in Burger Time, sprites are turned off
  appropriately, and the switch test in test mode works correctly.
  The hardware of this game is more similar to Eggs than I thought.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some fixes to 10 Yard Fight. [John Butler]

- The background was clipped too low in Phoenix. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added the missing scrolling background to Exed Exes. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprite/character priority in Gyruss. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed blinking in the Galaga starfield. [Martin Scragg]

- Galaga supports rotation (-ror and -rol). [Nicola Salmoria]



These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- All the Williams games. Samples are no longer needed and may be deleted.
  [Steven Hugg, Mirko Buffoni, Nicola Salmoria]

- Q*Bert Qubes. You just have to use Q*Bert's sound ROMs, they are the
  same. [Fabrice Frances]

- Tac/Scan (through samples). [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed some sound problems in Asteroids. [Andrew Scott]

- Added music to Kick. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved the Galaxian background hum, it also is no longer incorrectly
  played in Moon Cresta & others. [Andrew Scott]

- Digital audio in the Taito games (used for some sound effects, most
  notably Tarzan's yell in Jungle King). Also, music plays in Jungle King.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Moon Patrol, 10 Yard Fight, Kung Fu Master. [Aaron Giles]

- Mario Bros (partial, through samples). [Brad Oliver, Shane Monroe]

- Eggs. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the sound in Omega Race. It was playing too slow.
  Thanks to Stacy Joe Dunkle, Mike Cuddy and Al Kossow. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Congo Bongo (samples are needed to get full sound).
  [Ville Laitinen, Tim Lindquist]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Moon Patrol, Rally X, Vanguard, Super Cobra, Turtles, Xevious,
  Galaxy Wars. [Valerio Verrando]

- Fixed Krull and Donkey Kong 3. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Galaga. [Valerio Verrando]

- Starforce, Jump Bug, Bagman, Super Bagman, Time Pilot 84, Warp Warp.
  [Juan Carlos Lorente]


Other drivers improvements:
---------------------------

- The attract mode of Galaga works correctly. Qix runs correctly and
  without slowdowns. Test mode in Mr. Do's Castles & family works correctly,
  (dip switches in Do's Castle still don't work).
  All these changes are due to the interleaved CPU execution described
  below. [Nicola Salmoria]

- New fix to avoid lockup in Tempest after 150,000 points - this one should
  really work. [Keith Gerdes]

- Fixed the Fantasy driver. [Brian Levine]

- Several fixes and enhancements to the Williams driver. [Aaron Giles]

- Several fixes to the Williams driver: Blaster is finished, Sinistar is
  playable but there are some blitter bugs, Bubbles is better but still
  resets itself from time to time. [Marc Lafontaine]

- Fixed bug in Naughty Boy coin insertion/start game handling.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some fixes to the Star Wars mathbox. [Aaron Giles]

- The hardware of the Taito games (Elevator Action, Jungle King, Wild Western,
  Front Line) is emulated more faithfully. Playfield priority is accurate in
  Jungle King, however this broke Wild Western - strange.
  Front Line works.
  Merged all the drivers into taito.c [Nicola Salmoria]

- Tried to plug Triple Punch into the Scramble driver, but it doesn't work.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for New Rally X; colors are accurate in New Rally X ONLY - still
  wrong in Rally X until we find the color PROMs. Sound should finally be
  correct, both in Rally X and New Rally X. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Video drawing optimization to Mappy, plus test mode now works both in Mappy
  and Dig Dug 2. [Aaron Giles]

- In some games (e.g. Pacman, Galaxian, Rally X) the NumLock and CapsLock
  leds emulate the 1 player/2 players start lamps. [Sean Gugler]

- Fixed dip switches in Missile Command. [Marco Cassili]

- Early attempt at a Zookeeper driver, based on the Qix one, which
  unfortunately doesn't work yet. [John Butler, Ed Mueller]

- Moved the Hunchback driver into dkong.c, since that's where it belongs (but
  it still doesn't work due to encryption). [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added Gamma correction controls. Use Shift + Numeric pad +/- to change it.
  There are some games which are too dark on the default setting, instead of
  using the monitor settings use these controls to brighten the picture.
  Gamma correction also affects colors, like the girders in Donkey Kong.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a "Pro Action Replay"-like cheat finder. It is only available when
  -cheat is specified on the command line. [Marc Lafontaine]

- Some optimizations to the 6809 emulator. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Some optimizations to the 6809, and modified it to always fetch opcodes
  directly from RAM (much faster). The Ghosts 'n Goblins, Star Wars and
  Williams drivers needed reworking to support that. [Aaron Giles]

- Moved configuration and high score files to the CFG and HI subdirectories.
  They are not stored in the games subdirectories.
  I have provided a batch file (MOV.BAT) to automatically move your old
  settings in the new directories. Just start it from inside the MAME
  directory. It will spit out some error messages for missing files, don't
  worry and let it finish its job. [Nicola Salmoria]

  Having configuration files in a separate directory makes it easier to
  keep ROMs in .zip files. This is already done by some front-ends, but
  you can do it from the command line as well, just use this batch file.
  PKUNZIP must be in your path. The .zip files must be in the MAME directory
  and named after the game (i.e. pacman.zip).
@echo off
md %1
pkunzip >nul: %1 %1
MAME.EXE %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
deltree >nil: /y %1

  But even better, if you have ZipFolders or ZipMagic installed, MAME will
  automatically look into the .zip or .zif directory.
  ZipFolders and ZipMagic are trademarks of Mijenix Corporation. You can
  download a trial version from www.mijenix.com. I am in no way associated
  with Mijenix Corp. - I'm just a happy costumer.

- Removed "-trak" and "-mouse" options. Mouse support is now enabled by
  default. To disable it, use "-nomouse". [Bernd Wiebelt]

- "-vesa" picks the best VESA mode available. The new "-vesa1" forces VESA
  1.2. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- "-vg" removed. It is on by default now. [Bernd Wiebelt]


Source:
-------

- We are now using the "WIP 2.8" version of Allegro to compile the DOS
  version. You can get it from http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/.

- Two new OSD_KEY definitions: RCONTROL and ALTGR. CONTROL has been replaced
  by LCONTROL.

- Aligned to version 1.2 of Marcel de Kogel's Z80 emulator.

- New memory handling functions, about 10%-30% faster than before. Moved the
  memory code from cpuintrf.c to memory.c.
  Banked ROMs can now be handled in a cleaner and faster way. Use the new
  MRA_BANK1... types in the memory handler arrays, and cpu_setbank() to set
  the current bank. The Z80 and M6809 emulators natively support bank
  switching.
  IMPORTANT: for 24 bit addressing (i.e. 68000) you cannot associate a memory
  handler to a single byte. You must use four consecutive bytes, longword
  aligned. This was done to speedup word (2 bytes) and dword (4 bytes)
  operations.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles]

- New ROM_LOADEVEN and ROM_LOADODD macros. [Aaron Giles]

- CPU execution is interleaved. The cpu_slices_per_frame field in the
  MachineDriver controls how often control is passed from one CPU to
  another. 1 is the minimum, meaning that each CPU runs for the whole video
  frame before giving control to the others. The higher this setting, the
  more closely CPUs are interleaved and therefore the more accurate the
  emulation is. However, an higher setting also means slower performance.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed osd_obtain_pen(), the palette is passed to osd_create_display()
  instead. Also moved clearbitmap() to osd_clearbitmap(), which does a
  slightly different thing from what clearbitmap() did: it sets the bitmap
  to be generically "black", which doesn't necessarily imply filling it
  with Machine->pens[0]. Avoid using osd_clearbitmmap() in drivers: use the
  new fillbitmap(), instead, which accepts a pen number and a clip region.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced file related functions (fopen(), fread() and so on) with osd_
  equivalents. This avoids a good amount of hacking in the Mac port; plus
  it allows some system specific extensions, like supporting
  ZipMagic/ZipFolders under Windows 95. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Tweaked input port code. Added new fields for analog controls - clip,
  min, and max. Also added 2 new analog joystick types - IPT_AD_STICK_X and
  IPT_AD_STICK_Y.
  The new fields are packed into the same int field (arg) as the
  sensitivity and as such they can only be in the range of 0-255. The clip
  field clips the trackball/dial/stick deltas, a common callback routine
  task. Min and Max are so far only used in the AD_STICK types. They limit
  the range of motion for those sticks - used in Star Wars and Red Baron.
  [Brad Oliver]
  Additional tweaking of analog inputs, allowing them to be updated more
  than once per frame. This is needed by some games. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- removed osd_track_center(). We always use relative mouse movement now.
  [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Formalized support for dirty rectangles, via the function osd_mark_dirty().
  [Aaron Giles]
  It is mostly used by MacMAME, limited DOS support added by Bernd Wiebelt.

- updated pokyintf.c to be more like 8910intf.c. Variable clock frequency,
  port callbacks, a clipping parameter, variable updates per frame. Most
  noticeably, Tempest has much improved sound with more frequent updates.
  [Brad Oliver]
