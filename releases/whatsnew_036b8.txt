These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed sprite lag in cps1, bionicc, lastduel. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed priorities in wndrmomo and genpeitd. [E. Watanabe]

- Sped up a little the NeoGeo raster effects. Enabled them in Karnov Revenge
  and Galaxy Fight. Fixed the field in ssideki3 etc. [Massimo Morra]

- Fixed sprite Y offset in the Simpsons dreamland level. Apologies for taking
  so long, I couldn't find the time to play it that far and hadn't realized I
  just had to use the attract mode of the Japanese version. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- CVSD sound in Mouse Trap. [Dan Boris, Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Changed the autoframeskip code, making it less anxious to increase
  frameskip as soon as speed drops below 100%. Let's see if this makes things
  better or worse. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The mouse buttons are no longer aliases for joystick buttons, they are
  independently recognized. They are still considered "joystick" inputs though,
  so if you want to use them you have to redefine the controls in the Joystick
  menu. This is a minor annoyance that was needed to allow interfacing a Discs
  of Tron controller to the mouse port (spinner + up and down switches) while
  still using joystick buttons 1 and 2 for fire and deflect. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Support for ZIPped input files (-playback) and artwork. Well, PNG won't
  compress very well, but I added it anyway ;) [Juergen Buchmueller]

-------

- Finally fixed the CMPX instruction in the 680x core. On the 6800 it does
  not affect the C flag, on the others (6803, 63701) it does.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Fixes to the x86 asm 68k core. [Mike Coates]

- VIDEO_BUFFERS_SPRITERAM. See bionicc, darkseal, lastduel for usage examples.
  [Bryan McPhail]

- Added vh_eof_callback to the MachineDriver structure. See bionicc, cps1,
  lastduel for usage examples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Cleaned up the 6809 and Konami-2 emulations. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- C140 emulation. [Phil Stroffolino]
