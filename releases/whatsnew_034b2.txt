These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:

- The background in Golden Star changes color correctly. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Astro Fighter (PROMs required). [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Accurate colors in Lost Tomb (PROMs required). [Michael Appolo]

- Fixed tile flipping bug in Solomon's Key. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- The music in Bubble Bobble seems to stay in sync now. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Dynasty Wars works (actually it was already working, it's just that the dip
  switches had Freeze on by default).

- Front Line and Tin Star have the aiming dial (using a dual joystick setup).
  Also, you can now kill and be killed in Front Line. However, collision
  detection is not accurately emulated. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed ending in Robocop. [JC Alexander]

- *FINALLY* fixed Commando sometimes not starting. It was a bug in the decode
  routine, which has been completely rewritten. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Vector translucency can be turned off with -notranslucency.
  [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- TMS34010 emulator. [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari]

- Replaced the 6502 emulator with a new one which also supports 65C02 and 6510.
  Marat Fayzullin's core is no longer used. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed a bug in the 68000 BCD emulation which caused the F1 Dream timer to
  malfunction. [Nicola Salmoria]

- New function osd_on_screen_display() to show text over the game screen.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bug in the Z80 block I/O instructions (INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI,
  OUTD, OTIR, and OTDR). [Frank Palazzolo]

- Updated the FM emulation and the way the 8910 updates its buffers. FM also
  has support for YM2608 and YM2612, though they are not compiled in.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Rearranged the makefile using archives to work around E2BIG error on
  some machines. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Support for CRC-32 checksums instead of MAME's custom ones. The actual CRCs
  will be added later to the drivers. [John Butler]
