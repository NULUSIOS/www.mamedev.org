These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed scrolling in Major Title and priority in Hammerin' Harry.

These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Preliminary sound in Blade Master, Gunforce, UUCops and Lethal Thunder.

- Major changes to the memory interface.
  Drivers must use the new MEMORY_READ_START etc. macros, and for 16-bit CPUs
  the API is completely changed: the new READ16_HANDLER, WRITE16_HANDLER
  function types must be used for memory handlers. The macros READ_WORD(),
  WRITE_WORD() etc. are obsolete: handlers must directly access 16-bit wide
  arrays (use data16_t * instead of the old unsigned char *); always use the
  new macro COMBINE_DATA() to store data in the arrays correctlyhandling 8-bit
  wide memory accesses. Use ACCESSING_MSB and ACCESSING_LSB to know if the
  specified byte is being accessed (necessary for 8-bit wide external hardware).
  You no longer have to use MRA_BANKx for sparse RAM areas, you can use MRA_RAM
  just like with the 8-bit games.

  A handful of drivers haven't beenconverted to the new API yet, and therefore
  don't work. On startup, they will give the error
  cpu # uses wrong data width memory handlers!
  and refuse to start.

  The cheat system might be broken for 16-bit CPUs (untested).

- Changes to the tilemap API:
  - tilemap_render() is obsolete
  - struct tilemap is private - can't be accessed directly
  - tilemap_set_transparent_pen() and tilemap_set_transmask() replace direct
    poking in the tilemap
  - tilemap_mark_all_pixels_dirty() is obsolete (replaced by
    tilemap_dirty_palette() which is automatically called by palette_recalc())
  - additional parameter to tilemap_draw() to specify the priority mask to be
    stored in the priority buffer
  [Phil Stroffolino]

- Removed palette_transparent_color which is no longer needed by any driver.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed the "ui" parameter from osd_mark_dirty(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed osd_clearbitmap(). The correct way to black the screen in drivers
  is, and has always been, fillbitmap(). osd_alloc_bitmap() no longer has to
  clear the bitmap (it isn't necessary since it's cleared by the drivers
  anyway).
  extern int need_to_clear_bitmap removed as well; use schedule_full_refresh()
  instead (clearing the bitmap is not necessary because drivers are required to
  redraw the whole screen when full_refresh is 1). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rewritten the Nec CPU core, with correct timing and support for encryption.
  [Bryan McPhail]

- Preliminary Irem GA20 sound emulation. [Bryan McPhail]

- The profiler also watches memory read and write handlers. They were
  previously cumulated with the CPU emulation.
  Also, the profiler is now disabled in non-debug builds because the
  performance hit is quite noticeable. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The x86 asm 68000 core now has limited 68020 support and runs the Psikyo
  games, so is reenabled by default. [Darren Olafson]
