- 054539 sound emulation, used in X-Men, Xexex, GI Joe. [Olivier Galibert]

- All new set of functions for alpha blending support, used in Xexex.
  Porters: you have to support direct mapped 15 and 32 bits video modes. Remember
  to update osd_alloc_bitmap() too! See osdepend.h for the changes in
  osd_create_display() and osd_allocate_colors(). [Olivier Galibert]

- draw_crosshair(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag for game drivers.

- Standalone YM2413 emulator, giving much better sound in e.g. Pang.
  [Mitsutaka Okazaki, Sean Young]

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.34, this fixes problems with the
  Sidewinder gamepad. GNU Binutils 2.9.5.1 might also be needed to compile.

- New filtering code for the audio mixer. It is applied to audio streams
  generated at a sampling rate different from the sound card's one, improving
  quality. Some examples with a very audible difference are: fantasy, polyplay,
  galaxian (the background effect when playing), nibbler, vanguard and all the
  Seta games.

  [DOS] The "resamplefilter" option can be used to turn the filtering off.
