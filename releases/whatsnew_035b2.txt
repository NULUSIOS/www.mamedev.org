Note: the CPU cores are still in a state of flux. Most of the problems in 35b1
have been fixed, however some still remain (e.g. Gauntlet doesn't accept
coins and Exterminator crashes).

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed the sprite/playfield and playfield/playfield priorities in Bad Dudes /
  Dragon Ninja and Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed the title screen in P.O.W. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed gaps in the start/finish line in Neo Drift Out. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Attempt at emulating some raster effects in the NeoGeo games. The IRQ2
  handling is still 99% unknown, however you can see the field in Super
  Sidekicks 3 and 4. This is largely unaccurate, and VERY slow. Hit F1 to
  toggle the emulation on or off (by default it's on). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Almost accurate colors in Galivan. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved row scrolling in Street Fighter 2, plus several other fixes to the
  CPS1 games. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed sprite colors in Euro League. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprites disappearing abruptly in TMNT end of game credits. [Nicola
  Salmoria]

- Fixed the green and white flags in Championship Sprint / Super Sprint, and
  maybe other Atari System 2 sprites as well. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprite flipping in Jack the Giant Killer end sequence. [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed (?) the title in Galaxian Part X. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Mariner. [Gerald Coy]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Added support for the 7751 sound chip in Monster Bash. Two samples are still
  needed (discrete circuits). [Mike Balfour]

- Good progress in sound emulation of the Exidy games (Venture, Pepper 2, etc.)
  [Dan Boris]

- Fixed the YM2203 in Ghost Busters. [Bryan McPhail]

- Speech in TMNT. Sound should now be 100% complete. [Howie Cohen]

- uPD7759 support in Golden Axe, Shinobi, Passshtb, Alien Syndrome,
  Altered Beast. [Howie Cohen]

- Emulated speech in Sinistar. Samples are no longer used. [Alex Pasadyn]

- Sound in The Main Event. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound fade timer ports in the CPS1 games (see Willow's Test mode for an
  example). [Paul Leaman]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Side Pocket, Rolling Thunder. [Dave W.]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Seicross, Radical Radial, Frisky Tom. However
  Frisky Tom is still not playable (hangs when you fall). [Nicola Salmoria]

- The hang in Tapper should REALLY be fixed this time. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Emulated the protection in Knights of the Round and Carrier Air Wing.
  [Paul Leaman]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] The key to change frameskip is now F9 instead of F8. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- New 68000 C core. For testing purposes, this is also being used in the DOS
  version instead of the asm core. [Karl Stenerud]
  Differences:

  1. Faster.  This code is, barring ram fetch time, almost twice as fast as the
     existing C core in MAME.  I've done extensive speed profiling on both
     engines.  The only problem now is the slow memory access in MAME due to
     bankswitching et al.

  2. Emulation more correct.  I found many bugs in the MAME engine (and many,
     many more in mine for that matter) when I pitted them head-to-head.
     I have run random instructions from each opcode class at least 10 million
     times, comparing the resultant CPU states, and have left it running random
     instructions for 1 billion iterations.  In every case, I have adhered to
     the specs defined in M68000PM/AD REV. 1.

  3. Disassembler is correct.  The current M68000 disassembler in mame has a
     tendency to disassemble instructions that have an invalid EA mode.

  4. Cycle counting is 99.9% correct.  The only instructions which don't have
     correct cycle counts are divs, divu, muls, mulu, and they're not worth
     counting correctly. (I'm not about to waste emulation time counting 0-1 and
     1-0 sequences).

  5. > 32 bit friendly.  I've taken care to ensure maximum portability without
     sacrificing speed.  The result is conditional compiling dependant on your
     architecture.  I've also implemented and tested a compatible solution for
     architectures that lack 8, 16, or 32 bit signed storage types.

  6. The code is carefully laid out to be readable. (I beg to differ - NS)

- Fixed some bugs in the I8039 emulation. [Brian Stern]

- Z8000 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- NEC uPD7759 emulation. This is used by TMNT, System 16, and others.
  [Juergen Buchmueller, Mike Balfour, Howie Cohen]

- CVSD emulation, used for speech in Sinistar and in the 34010 games (Smash TV
  etc.). [Larry Bank, Alex Pasadyn]
