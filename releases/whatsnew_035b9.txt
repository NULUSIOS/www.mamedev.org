0.35 BETA 9

After the problems with the last few betas, this should be a stable release
again. All games which worked before the core changes should be working again.
Let us know if you find some still broken.


New games supported:
--------------------

Sindbad Mystery [Nicola Salmoria, Mike Balfour]
Yamato (preliminary) [Nicola Salmoria]
Super Burger Time [Bryan McPhail]
Gaplus [Manuel Abadia, Ernesto Corvi]
Van Van Car [Allard van der Bas]
Super Locomotive [Zsolt Vasvari]


New clones supported:
---------------------

Crazy Climber (bootleg set 2) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Pac Man (modified) [Allard van der Bas]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed background in Pig Newton. [Mike Balfour]

- Fixed the Galaxian-style starfield. Believe it or not, it had been broken
  since day 1. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Converted the System 16 drivers to use the TileMap system - they are now
  cleaner, faster, and support screen rotation. [Phil Stroffolino]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed hangs in Super Real Darwin when big bosses come, however the order
  they appear in is likely wrong (it's a protection issue). If you know the
  correct order, contact mish@tendril.force9.net. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the protection in Jump Bug (Rock-ola). Some ROM splitup too, and
  fixed colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New tweaked 256x256 VGA modes (both scanlines and noscanlines)
  stretched to fill the screen. They are automatically used for horizontal
  games, and are preferable to the -stretch option since they are faster.
  You might have to adjust your monitor settings to make them properly
  centered and fill the screen (use the border displayed on startup as a
  guideline). [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- The debugger is almost complete. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Redesigned the struct InputPort to use less space, and changed how analog
  inputs are defined. An additional benefit is that the keys for digital
  emulation of analog inputs are now defined in the Keys for this Game menu,
  together with all other keys, instead that in the Analog Controls menu.
  The Analog Controls menu remains to set the other parameters.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added default strings for dip switches. For example, instead of "Cabinet",
  use DEF_STR( Cabinet ). The constants are defined in inptport.h.
  [Nicola Salmoria]
