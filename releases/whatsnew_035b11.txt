These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Several fixes and improvements to D-Day. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed foreground transparency in Pac-Land round 19. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Better backdrop for Battle Zone (bzone.png). [Nathan Sturm]

- Fixed background in Street Fighter 1. [Olivier Galibert]

- Fixed sprite glitches in Jail Break and Iron Horse. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprites colors in Galivan. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Support for Eliminator 2/4 player samples and additional sounds for
  Zektor. [Jim Hernandez]

- Fixed tune in Phoenix. [Richard Davies]

- Added ADPCM samples to Mad Gear. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added support for .wav samples. The custom .sam samples are no longer
  supported (you can use the sam2wav converter to convert them). [Aaron Giles]

- [DOS] Rough triple buffering support in VESA modes. You can turn it on with
  the -triplebuffer switch. It is not guaranteed to work well, but if it does,
  it offers results similar to -waitvsync but without the performance drop.
  Do NOT use it together with -vsync or -waitvsync. [Nicola Salmoria]

- A missing ROM for which no good dump is known to exist is no longer a fatal
  error - you can start the emulation even if the file is missing. Its space
  will be filled with random data. Of course the game will probably
  malfunction. The output of -verifyroms is slightly changed, it says "NO GOOD
  DUMP KNOWN" now and doesn't print 00000000 checksums. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- Major overhaul to the Atari games, and fixes to the 68000 and 6502 cores to
  get them going properly. [Aaron Giles]
