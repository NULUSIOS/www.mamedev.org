These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- All drivers with a handcrafted palette got broken in beta 2. They are now
  fixed.

- Better colors in Side Pocket. [Marc Vergoossen]

- Accurate (?) colors in Fast Freddie/Fly-Boy. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Accurate colors in Jump Coaster. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed colors in Road Runner. [Aaron Giles]

- The Gauntlet drivers are now color-reduced (faster & better). [Aaron Giles]

- Accurate colors in metack and possibly the other Gameplan games. [Chris Moore]

- Fixed a couple of palette problems with Snow Bros. It also no longer uses a
  16 bit video mode, so it's faster. [nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Put back sample support in Q*Bert Qubes. [Rodimus Prime]

- Music in 3 Stooges. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Emulated sound in Lunar Lander. [Keith Wilkins]

- Sound in the Gameplan games. [Chris Moore]

- Increased music tempo in Snow Bros.

- Updated VLM5030 emulation (Punch Out etc.). Since quality is still bad, the
  emulator is only used when samples are not avaialble. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Locomotion, Jungler, Commando (Sega), Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Rygar,
  Gemini Wing, Silkworm, City Connection, Trojan, Up'n Down. [Dani Portillo]

- Fixed Diamond Run. [Mike Balfour]

- Front Line. [Steve Ellenoff]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Another step forward in getting Super Punch Out to work (still NOT
  playable). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Proper emulation of the ROM decryption in Burger Time. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Improved Spy Hunter controls (you can play with the mouse or even a wheel
  now). [Alex Judd]

- Changed the 6502 emulation to disable interrupts on a reset. Not sure if
  this is the correct behaviour, but Centipede needed it for the service mode
  to work. [This was actually a change in BETA 1 which I forgot to mention]

- New -listdetails option, to create a detailed list of drivers and the
  hardware they use. [Mirko Buffoni]
