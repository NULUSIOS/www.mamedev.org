0.26

- After so much time of hard work the policy of "back to quality" is starting
  to bring back the efforts.  I'm proud to announce I'v beated Mr Do's Castle.
  Done one, done all.  So now we have also Mr Do! RunRun and Mr Do! Wild Ride.
  Thanks to the invaluable help of Nicola, they are also arcade colors perfect,
  very fast (!) and each game has audio support and hiscore saving! :D

- Me and Aaron Giles (agiles@mail1.sirius.com) have added support for MAPPY!!
  One of the most requested games.  It was a pleasure working with Aaron!  He
  also added sound support and very close arcade colors (I think to have found
  the color_prom... if it's the correct prom it will be added in the next
  release).  Hiscore saving is supported as well.

- Thanks to the outstanding combined efforts of Brad Oliver, Bernd Wiebelt
  and Allard Van Der Bas, MAME entered in vectorial emulation world! (YEAH!!!)
  All in a time, we have support for Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Black Widow
  Battlezone, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Red Baron, Spaceduel, Tempest!!!

- Again Aaron Giles added sound support to Super Pac Man!

- Patrick Lawrence (pjl@ns.net) did a great work adding trackball support to
  the main core system.  Trackball is enable with -trak parameter.  Trackball
  support has been added to Centipede and Reactor.  Also, Patrick provided
  a driver for Crystal Castles.  Great Work! ;)

- And three... Aaron added support for Dig Dug!!  Hey man, you'r at a step
  to become a God of Arcade emulation ;)

- Mike Coates has joined to the "back to quality" team.  He added support for
  SeaWolf ][, and improved Space Zap and Gorf (which is still unplayable).
  Also Robby Roto is now fully playable (you'll need a bug free rom set).

- Ray Giarratana (ray@loop.com) added support for Missile Command.  I didn't
  include modifications for trackball for now.  The code needs to be cleaned
  a bit, but the game is still playable.

- Enrique Sanchez provided me documentation for Yie Air Kung Fu.  Also,
  Philip Stroffolino (phil@maya.com) sent me a more complete driver than
  mine for this game which is now playable.

- Eric Anschuetz fixed a bug in joystick redefinition menu.  Also added the
  selection support for Any Button ("A" key), and None ("N" key).

- Fabrice Frances added a driver for 3 Stooges.

- Andrew Scott provided a better sound support for Phoenix.  Melody is still
  missing, because Shaun's board doesn't have it.

- Nicola fixed Jump Bug driver which is now perfect.  Colors are still wrong
  without proms.

- Morten Eriksen (Morten.Eriksen@due.unit.no) added hiscore saving to
  Ghosts 'n Goblins.

- Valerio Verrando provided a new tweaked mode 256x232 for Crystal Castles.
  He also provided a new tweaked video mode to get vsynced 60Hz (perfect
  speed) with 256x256 games.  It has horizontal clock recover (thus video is
  less mashed vertically, without having to modify monitor settings, and it
  doesn't be confused with 224x288 by monitors that remember settings. Really
  nice on scrolling games:  try it with "-noscanlines -vsync -vgafreq 1"

- Fixed Commando dip switch bonus settings.  Also fixed a setting in Ant
  Eater dipswitch.

- Fixed a bug that locked your PC if BLASTER variable was not found (thanks
  to James Oliver for the suggestion).

- Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed sound tempo speed in Elevator Action (tempo speed
  is 37.5Khz).

- Added support for two versions of Pengo (one with the music of Popcorn
  and a clone).

Sources:
- Me, Nicola, Bernd and Patrick have heavily changed the main core set of
  sources.  Improvements to speed, memory access, drivers structure were
  done.  We strongly suggest to developers to start their code on a clean
  0.26 version.

- Opcode decode and graphic decode are now done by a single function in
  one step.

- Tatsuyuki Satoh (tatuyuki@tky.threewebnet.or.jp) optimized DrawGfx()
  function in case TRANSPARENCY_PEN and TRANSPARENCY_COLOR without remap,
  producing a speed increment of 22-25% (try yourself with Elevator Action!)

- Mauro Minenna introduced a new option (-dir4) that simplify the use of
  the joysticks to be connected on the keyboard.  This modify resolves the
  problem of diagonal direction in games such as PacMan, Popeye, and Kung Fu
  Master.
