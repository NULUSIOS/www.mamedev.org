Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New digital YM3812/YM3526 emulator (in the DOS version, use -noym3812opl to
  enable it). It doesn't support the rhythm section yet, but is overall better
  than the old one. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Triple buffer support in tweaked VGA modes. Warning: this is slower
  than standard tweaked modes. [Brian Lewis]

- [DOS] If you are using a HotRod, use the -hotrod switch to adjust the default
  keyboard settings. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.23. IMPORTANT: there is a bug in
  Allegro's new keyboard hangling, which will prevent numeric pad keys from
  working properly when used together with ctrl and alt. Until it is fixed in
  the main Allegro distribution, you will have to replace the source file
  allegro\src\misc\pckeys.c with the provided one, and recompile Allegro.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The new Allegro provides support for PSX and N64 pads (info here:
  http://www.debaser.force9.co.uk/ccmame), and for the Wingman Warrior.
  The names for the -joy parameter are
  psxlpt1
  psxlpt2
  psxlpt3
  n64lpt1
  n64lpt2
  n64lpt3
  wingwarrior
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rewritten the OS dependant keyboard interface. A rewrite of the koystick
  interface will follow. The OS dependant code now only has to provide four
  functions:
  osd_get_key_list()
  osd_is_key_pressed()
  osd_customize_inputport_defaults() [optional]
  osd_wait_keypress() [optional]
  everything else is handled by the main core.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New sprite manager, used in System 16, Ninja Gaiden, Shoot Out, Blood Bros.
  [Phil Stroffolino]

- Took the gfx drawing functions out of common.c into the new dragfx.c.
  In preparation for further changes to the data structures, abstracted the
  low level data copying and used macros to generate 8-bit and 16-bit
  versions. [Nicola Salmoria]
