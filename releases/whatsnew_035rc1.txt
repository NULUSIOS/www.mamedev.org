Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The Pause key can be changed from the "Keys (defaults)" configuration menu.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a palette viewer to the gfx viewer (F4). [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New video modes from CabMAME: low scanrate modes for connection to
  NTSC/PAL and arcade monitors. -monitor NNNN selects the monitor type:
  "standard" (default), "ntsc", "pal", "arcade". -centerx N and -centery N
  each take a signed value (-8 to 8 for centerx, -16 to 16 for centery) and let
  you shift the low scanrate modes around. -waitinterlace forces update of
  both odd and even fields of an interlaced display for each game loop.
  [Brian Lewis]

- [DOS] Since there are now many tweaked VGA modes which may have compatibility
  problems with some video cards / monitors, they are now off by default. By
  default, VESA is used; the -vesa command line switch is no longer used.
  Instead, there is a -tweak switch which enables the VGA tweaked modes.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New tweaked VGA modes: 384x240 (for CPS1, Pang etc.), 384x256 (for Lode
  Runner etc.), 336x240 (for Gauntlet and other Atari games), 320x240 (for
  NeoGeo and others). They are used automatically, if your video card/monitor
  can't handle them, use -notweak (or try adjusting the parameters in mame.cfg
  if you know what you are doing). [Brian Lewis, Andrea Mazzoleni]

- [DOS] Removed the -nodouble command line option. Use -nostretch instead. If
  you are updating from an earlier beta, make sure to delete mame.cfg (or
  manually update it) otherwise stretch will be disabled. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Changed the analog port handling to avoid problems with keyboard control
  (e.g. Arkanoid 2). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added support for slave mode to the MSM5205 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]
