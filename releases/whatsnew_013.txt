Program:
- Added the most frequently asked feature: high score saving. Check the
  table at the beginning of readme.txt to see which games already support
  it.
  High scores are also reset-proof: you can reset the game by pressing F3
  without losing them. To reset the high scores to their default, just
  delete xxx\xxx.hi where xxx is the game name.
  Note that hi score saving will NOT work if the default hi scores have been
  modified in the ROMs. Use the original ROMs.

- Fixed all of the problems in Burger Time related to ROM encryption. Slices
  fall more than one level when an enemy is on them, no more crashes when a
  bonus life is earned, the high screen table works, two players mode works,
  and other things.

- Support for an alternate ROM set for Burger Time, which is likely an
  earlier version.

- Millipede's dip switches now work.
  DELETE MILLIPED\MILLIPED.DSW, OTHERWISE THE GAME WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- Marc Lafontaine submitted a new palette for Zaxxon.

- Richard Davies provided a new Phoenix/Pleiads driver with partial sound
  support.

- Fixed "froggers" (I broke it while adding sound to Scramble).
  It now also uses the correct palette. Yes, I know that it is completely
  different from the real Frogger. This is a bootleg version, remember.

- As promised, I modified the 8910 emulator to set the clock frequency at run
  time, so sound in Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong is now back as normal.

- ue303ey@sunmail.lrz-muenchen.de reports that changing the horizontal total
  register of the custom video modes (0x3d4, 0x00) from 0x5f to 0x61 makes
  them work on his monitor. I experimentally made the change.
  IF THE CUSTOM MODES WORKED FOR YOU IN VERSION 0.12 AND THEY DON'T WORK ANY
  MORE, PLEASE NOTIFY ME AND I WILL REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS SETTING.

- Keith Smethers suggested to add -vgafreq n command line parameters,
  to select the VGA clock frequency. This may reduce flicker, especially in
  the 224x288noscanlines mode.
  WARNING: THE FREQUENCIES USED MIGHT BE WAY OUTSIDE OF YOUR MONITOR RANGE,
  AND COULD EVEN DAMAGE IT. USE THESE OPTIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

- I began working on Moon Patrol's background. It's quite messed up now.

- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in Bomb Jack background colors.

Source:
- Use latest version of Marat's 6502 engine.

- Changes to struct GameDriver to accomodate the high score saving functions.
  I also moved the decryption pointers at the end, so it is not necessary to
  explicitly define them as 0 when they are not needed.
  Check driver.c to see how high score handlers should be written.
  hiscore_load() is called every vblank until it returns nonzero; this allows
  it to wait for the hi score table to be fully initialized before replacing
  it. To avoid saving an incomplete table, hiscore_save() is called only
  if hiscore_load() previously returned nonzero.
