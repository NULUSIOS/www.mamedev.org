Program:
- Moon Patrol support. There is no scrolling background because I don't know
  where to place it... can anyone provide a screen snapshot?

- Burger Time and Donkey Kong 3 drivers provided by Mirko Buffoni.
  The colors for Burger Time should be accurate, but I'm not quite sure -
  can anyone confirm?

- Fixed joystick controls for Congo Bongo.

- Lionel Theunissen dumped the color PROM of his Uniwars board and... it's
  different from the one provided by Gary Walton. Galaxian boards were widely
  pirated so it's difficult to determine which one is the "correct" palette.
  What I did was set the Uniwars driver to use one palette, and the "Japanese
  Irem" to use the other. Play the one you prefer.

- Marc Vergoossen provided a much better palette for Zaxxon.

Source:
- increased the maximum size of the graphic elements that can be handled by
  decodegfx() from 32x32 to 64x64. Actually I would have needed 256x64 to do
  Moon Patrol backgrounds, but that seemed slightly overkill ;-)
