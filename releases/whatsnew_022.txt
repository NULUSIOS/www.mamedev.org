[ Sorry to be late, but this is my birthday MAME release and I wanted it to
  be as good as possible.  Enjoy, and send a postcard if you like ;)  NdMix ]

0.22

Program:
- Nicola added COMMANDO!!  Another of my favourite games back to life ;)
  High score supported as well.  Original Sound is done by YM2203
  (FM synthesis) while now is done by 8910 (no FM).
  So music is not present.

- And here it is:  thanks to Roberto Ventura's superdetailed documentation
  I'v added Ghost 'n Goblin support.  I lost one week because of a bug in
  the new 6809 emulator, so I switch back to the previous one.  Big thanks
  to Nicola that fixed some stupid bugs in color palette generation. ;)
  We need a skilled player.  READ THE README.TXT FILE!

- Another one added:  based on GnG hardware I'v added Diamond Run support.
  Don't know if the banks mode switch is right, it's too slow for me
  to go further the first level!

- Added Vulgus support.  Colors are wrong unless I find the color proms.
  High score save supported.  I played around with Dip Switches: they are
  almost right, though, but there should be also a sound toggle while in
  attract mode.

- Rick Wirch (wirch@execpc.com) proposed a better optimization to Cpu_readmem
  and Cpu_writemem.  Speed results are good under DOS and Windows.

- Brad Oliver provided me a lot of suggestions to improve portability and
  fixed a lot of bugs.

- Paul Berberich fixed some colors of Congo Bongo.  They are not right but
  a lot better of the previous.  Screenshots could be useful.

- I have fixed colors in Centipede.  Thanks to Ivan Mackintosh for sending
  me the info.

- Nicola added cars in radar update of RallyX and improved color palette
  emulation in Bombjack which has now perfect colors.

- Fixed credit bugs in Elevator Action and Turtles.  REMEMBER TO DELETE
  THE PREVIOUS .DSW FILES OTHERWISE THE GAMES WON'T WORK PROPERLY!

- Added preliminary sound support to Elevator Action and Jungle King.
  Tarzan yell scream sample missing.

- Time pilot has now 100% correct colors (thanks Virtu-Al!).

- Some fixes to sprite priority in Frogger.

- Added high score support to Amidar, Frogger.

- Added Phoenix Amstar (clone) support, Pac Man Plus (clone) and fixed
  all Invader's clones bugs.  Also fixed charset of all Invader's clones.

Sources:
- Changed CPUIntrf regarding readmem/writemem optimizations

- Minor fixes to some drivers

- Bernd Wiebelt provided modifications to MSDOS.C for Vesa 2.0 linear
  and banked extensions.  Also inline assembly double pixeling provided
  a faster approach on slower videocards.  Check the readme.txt file for
  new video options.
