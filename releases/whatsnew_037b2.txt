  in progress. [Brad Oliver]

  [Brad Oliver]

Source:
-------

- Replaced instances of "if (errorlog) fprintf(errorlog," with a call to the
  new function logerror().

- New filetypes that must be supported by the OS dependant code:
  FILETYPE_HIGHSCORE_DB
  FILETYPE_HISTORY
  FILETYPE_CHEAT
  FILETYPE_LANGUAGE

  new functions:
  osd_readkey_unicode
  osd_fgetc
  osd_ungetc
  osd_fgets
  osd_feof
  osd_ftell

  new filed in struct Gameoptions: language_file. The OS dependant code must
  initialize it if it wants to use a translation file.
  [Brad Oliver]

- I added a new parameter to the end of the EEPROM interface to enable multiple
  reads to occur after a single read command. Added an EEPROM_set_data()
  routine that can be used to explicitly initialize the contents of the EEPROM
  if the NVRAM file isn't found. [Aaron Giles]
