Program:
- Centipede support. This is the first 6502 game supported by MAME. I'm
  currently using Marat Fayzullin's engine.

- Nibbler support. This is the second 6502 game supported by MAME ;-)
  Interesting hardware: no sprites, two playfields, and it uses RAM for
  character generation (redefining the characters to animate the worm).

- I had also broken Pleiades, fixed. That's the drawback of emulating more
  than 60 games, I can't check them all before releasing a new version ;-)

- Ville Laitinen provided a Congo Bongo driver! The colors are terrible ;-),
  but it's playable.

- Thanks to Valerio Verrando, now -noscanlines works on Pac Man and the other
  games using a 224x288 screen. If you have problems with the default video
  mode try this one, it will hopefully solve them.

- I received no less than three different palettes for Donkey Kong Jr., from
  Brad Oliver, Marc Vergoossen and Richard Davies. The one included is from
  Marc.

- Thanks to Gary Walton and Simon Walls, we now have 100% accurate colors in
  Crush Roller and Uniwars/Japirem. Moon Cresta and Moon Quasar might be
  correct as well, but I'm not sure.

- Fixed a small graphics glitch in the background of Bomb Jack's third level.
  Thanks to Philip Chapman for the report.

Source:
- Support for 6502 CPU. From a driver writer point of view, it is used just
  like the Z80, the only difference being that you have to specify CPU_M6502
  instead of CPU_Z80 in the MachineDriver definition.
  Multiple CPUs are still NOT supported.

- New function in common.c: decodechar(). It was originally part of
  decodegfx(), and is used to convert one single char from the machine format
  to the one used by the emulator. This function was needed by the Nibbler
  driver to dynamically convert the graphics at runtime.
