0.112
-----

Happy 10th Anniversary! Today's release marks 10 years since the
original release of 0.1. After 10 years, hundreds of developers,
thousands of games, and tens of thousands (if not more) of hours of
hard work, MAME development is still going strong. Thanks to everyone
who has supported this project over the years!

Also a big thanks goes out to everyone who has contributed. Although
I am certain there are some people left out of this list, it should
give an indication of just how many people truly care about preserving
arcade history:

==========================================================================

0.111u6

Source Changes
--------------

Fixed the data fetch and scrolling calculation for almost all video 
modes in the Amiga driver. [Ernesto Corvi]

Emulated the trench circuit in Space Encounters. [Adam Bousley]

Added win_output_debug_string_utf8(); a UTF-8 wrapper for
OutputDebugString(). Changed code to use it. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed the disassembly, operation, and cycle timing of many Thumb 
instructions in the ARM7 core. [MooglyGuy]

Defined new osd core function osd_is_absolute_path(). Changed behavior
of core fileio so that absolute paths are identified and search paths
ignored in that case. [Nathan Woods]

Improved validity check for coinage order so that it prints out the
correct order if an error is detected. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed clocks and other details in Dream World based on new
measurements. [David Haywood, Guru]

Implemented video circuits in the Midway 8080 driver based on
schematics. Note that this affected the visible area, so overlays will
need to be adjusted. Standardized the visible area across all games.
Implemented Phantom II cloud generator. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed the contract of the tilemap_create() call so that it is
guaranteed to succeed or die trying. Cleaned up code paths that 
checked the result of this operation to be simpler as a result.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary support for the built-in effects DSP in the SCSP, 
which lots of games use for reverb, QSound, and other effects. 
[ElSemi]

Removed archaic i8080_EXACT flag from the 8085 core. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated Midway 8080 driver to use properly computed video timings and
scanline interrupts. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed assertion in MPU4 driver. Fixed the mechanical meter operation,
enabling coin entry in Connect 4. [James Wallace]

Added mappings for break and pause keys. [Dirk Best]

Incorporated changes to MESS CPU cores to fix asserts and improve
Z80GB emulation. [Nathan Woods, Wilbert Pol]

Correctly connected sound IRQ in GX400/Nemesis driver. [R. Belmont]

Rewrote the SN76477 emulator from scratch. The main difference between 
the old one and the new one is that it is based on measurements from a
real chip. Also the emulator is fully analog, meaning that 
timings/frequencies, etc. are based on voltage levels. This gives a 
much more true-to-life emulation where the weird behavior of the real 
chip comes emulated for free. The code itself is also a lot simpler 
and more understandable. [Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud]

Cleaned up stray variables from the crosshair drawing removal. Also
removed some orphaned function declarations. [Oliver Stoneberg]

Added the missing volume and frequency controls to the Berzerk driver
and s14001a core. Fixed the issue with random words being spoken 
instead of the proper ones. Word is now latched at the proper time.
[Lord Nightmare]

Implemented flickering of the strobe light in Space Encounters, to be
eventually connected with artwork. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed driver_add/find/remove functions to fatalerror if they cannot
find their targets. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for screenless drivers. [Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods]

Fixed a couple of errors introduced in the OKI6295 pin shuffling.
[David Haywood]

Cleaned up DIP switches and added documentation to the Outrun driver.
[Brian Troha]

Fixed sound clock frequency in the NMG5 driver. [Brian Troha]

Fixed sound clock frequency in Night Slasher. [Sonikos]

Updated Sega System 16/18 drivers to be mono, and swapped button 1/2
to match instruction card. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Moved some of the tool sources to a new subdirectory tools.
[Aaron Giles]

Tweaked the main makefile to better support parallel builds.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed line array from mame_bitmap. Converted dozens of drivers over
to using BITMAP_ADDR macros instead. [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic crosshairs so they are not quite so automatic.
They now need to be explicitly specified by the driver in the input
ports. Also changed the PORT_CROSSHAIR macro to take a shorter form
of the axis name. Updated all lightgun drivers to have this macro in
its default state. [Aaron Giles]

Added sliders for debugging crosshair positioning (debug build only).
[Aaron Giles]

Changed xevious to use irq0_assert_line instead of irq0_pulse_line
to prevent it from dropping interrupts. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Gorf to use HOLD_LINE instead of PULSE_LINE for scanline
interrupts. The timing is still off, but the game runs now.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed time H/V position reporting during the first frame of execution
using the new video routines. [Aaron Giles]

[James Wallace]

Updated built-in expat code to version 2.0. [Atari Ace]

Fixed sound samples in Indian Battle. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added state saving to mhavoc. Also fixed sparkling vectors so 
slowdowns and vector list overflows can be expected. It looks much 
nicer, though. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Removed XORs from almost all CPS2 games in place of proper emulation
of the encryption. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added sound effects emulation to the Berzerk driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed font aspect ratio on non-1:1 resolutions. [Aaron Giles]

Added mechanism to cache a binary format of BDF fonts for improved
loading speed. Also added a bit of progress when loading huge BDF
fonts so that you know what's happening. [Aaron Giles]

Removed gross TMS9928a configuration in place of more standard
techniques. Updates the Cliffhanger and sg1000a drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------

Added support for the Pioneer PR-8210 laserdisc player.
[Ernesto Corvi]

Added two new convenience macros for input ports: PORT_DIPUNUSED and
PORT_DIPUNUSED_DIPLOC. [stephh]

Updated DIP switches in the cave driver and added locations. [stephh]

Improved DIP switches in sbrkout and converted "fake" DIP switches
into configuration switches. [stephh]

Improved DIP switches in Zero Hour. [Mike Ellery]

Added DIP locations to the m90 driver. [Brian Oberholtzer]

Unified the Forgotten Worlds driver with the cps1 driver and
connected the OKI6295 pin control properly. [David Haywood]

Modified the makefile to make it possible to independently specify
symbols generation and optimization levels. [Atari Ace]

Fixed system time counters in the Amiga code. [Ernesto Corvi]

Major rewrite of the Midway 8080 black & white driver, separating it
from the huge 8080bw driver and making the following changes:
[Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud]

  - 'True-to-hardware' emulation of the shifting circuits
  - Identified and stubbed sound triggers
  - Fixed DIP switches, where necessary (most games)
  - Added DIPLOCATION to all switches
  - Added watchdog
  - Added coin counter
  - Added lamp outputs to Sea Wolf, Guided Missile, Space Encounters,
     Phantom II, Bowling Alley
  - Added stereo sound to Gun Fight, Guided Missile, M-4
  - Partial sound emulation in Tornado Baseball, Boot Hill,
     Desert Gun, Double Play, Dog Patch, Blue Shark
  - Properly emulated shifter circuit in Boot Hill
  - Added gun recoil output to Desert Gun
  - Added second set of analog controls to Clowns
  - Fixed analog controls in Dog Patch
  - Added SN76477 sound effect to Space Encounters
  - Added non-memory mapped coin counters to Space Invaders,
     Blue Shark, and Space Invaders II
  - Added proper watchdog times to all the games
  - Breadboarded the noise clocks and ensured their frequencies
     were correct

Added support for the lamp matrix to the video callback in the 
Scorpion 2 driver, and updated lamps and inputs to better fit the 
new UI. VFD support has been moved to a configuration switch, as 
the output is actually always occurring - the switch mimics the 
effect of plugging in or removing the VFD from the control point.
[James Wallace]

Improved sound output in the MediaGX driver. [Ville Linde]

Preliminary emulation of the TSI S14001A speech synthesizer as found 
in Berzerk/Frenzy (and also Stern pinballs).
[Lord Nightmare, Kevtris, R. Belmont]

Added missing linescroll effect to Magical Cat Adventure and 
Nostradamus. It can be seen in action on the first levels of both 
games. [David Haywood]

Minor cleanup of mind-bending codce is the konamigx driver.
[R. Belmont]

Fixed crash in the Sega System 24 driver. [David Haywood]

Added a validity check that input port names are valid UTF-8 strings.
[Nathan Woods]

Improved DIP switches in the tumbleb.c driver. [stephh]

Added a large update to the legionna driver with much more 
documentation on the protection and other updates. [Angelo Salese]

Added cdp1869 video emulation to the Cidelsa driver. The games still 
don't work due to timing and interrupt issues. [Curt Coder]

Fixed crash in Tao Taido driver. [David Haywood]

Made suprnova RLE rendering safe from out-of-bounds accesses.
[David Haywood]

Many improvements to the Midnight Landing driver, including partial
sound, partial video emulation, and controls. Still not working,
though. [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed TMS9928 so it recalculates the pattern mask when its 
dependancies change so we don't end up in weird half-modes.
[R. Belmont]

Added support in the user interface to render all text assuming it is
UTF-8 encoded. This means that UTF-8 encoded Unicode names can be
used in in-game descriptions, etc. But first you will need a unicode
capable BDF font. [Aaron Giles]

Removed Vista build hacks from windows.mak as they are no longer
necessary. [Aaron Giles]

Removed hacky use of the 'depth' field of mame_bitmaps. Bitmaps are
now allocated with an enumerated 'format' instead. This is internally
translated into bits-per-pixel in a normalized way. Also removed 
Machine->color_depth, which was often misused. [Aaron Giles]

Added new macro BITMAP_ADDR that can be used for addressing into
bitmaps. Removed the use of bitmap->line[] in the core code. The 
line[] array will eventually be obsoleted, so stop using it.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed operation of plot_pixel, read_pixel, and plot_box. The first
two are now inline functions and the latter just maps to fillbitmap
via another inline function. [Aaron Giles]

Added new required machine driver entry MDRV_SCREEN_FORMAT() which
specifies the bitmap format for the screen. Removed the 
VIDEO_RGB_DIRECT and VIDEO_NEEDS_6BITS_PER_GUN flags that used to
determine the bitmap format implicity. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated the following obsolete machine driver entries:

   MDRV_FRAMES_PER_SECOND -> MDRV_SCREEN_REFRESH_RATE
   MDRV_VBLANK_DURATION   -> MDRV_SCREEN_VBLANK_TIME(TIME_IN_USEC(x))
   MDRV_VISIBLE_AREA      -> MDRV_SCREEN_VISIBLE_AREA

[Aaron Giles]

Added a new mechanism for rendering the crosshairs on lightgun games.
Crosshairs are automatically rendered if lightgun controllers are
specified; the game no longer has to render them. Any other analog
axis can be configued to use crosshairs via the new PORT_CROSSHAIR
macro. Crosshairs are also now rendered in different colors for 
different players, and done as an overlay using the new rendering 
system instead of drawing into the game bitmap, which means they no 
longer show up on screenshots. If you don't like the built-in 
crosshairs, you can make your own. Just call them cross0.png 
(player 1), cross1.png (player 2), etc. and place them in the root 
of your artwork directory. [Aaron Giles]

Changed F1 crosshair toggle. By default crosshairs are on for all
configured players. Toggling once will turn them all off. Each
sucessive toggle will enable one player at a time until all players
are again visible. [Aaron Giles]

Added support in chd.c for lossy compressors, computing CRCs and other
hashes based on the decompressed output in those cases. Also added
support for asynchronous reads/writes using the new osd work item
interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several bugs in the Windows implementation of the osd work item
interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Simplified the hard disk interfaces a bit. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several bugs and improved emulation of the Z80 SIO chip.
[Aaron Giles]

Improved behavior of the laserdisc code when seeking so it doesn't
get "stuck". Added preliminary support for the 22VP932 laserdisc
player. [Aaron Giles]

OSD porters take note of the changes to the OSD core routines.


Source Changes
--------------

Added save state support to the tubep driver. [Svante Gerhard]

Added save state support to the steppers module. [James Wallace]

Added the remaining input pins to the SN76477 Interface. If these 
pins are constant, they can now be defined in the structure as 
opposed to having to call functions in an init routine. Modified all 
the drivers that use a 76477. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed file I/O functions from osd_tool.h in favor of the ones in
osdepend.h. Updated tools accordingly. Added new flag
OSD_FLAG_CREATE_PATHS to the open command. [Nathan Woods]

Moved OKIM6295 pin 7 state (internal divider) to internal structure. 
Updated all drivers to specify pin state when setting the interface. 
Added comments for all cases where the original frequency wasn't / 132 
or /165 as the real pin state is unknown. [David Haywood]

Updated Toki driver to display visual DIPs for the game.
[Brian Oberholtzer]

Added sprite X flip and removed unneeded hack in wheelfir driver.
[Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed several issues with the new Unicode support. [Nathan Woods]

Changed uimenu.c to allow displaying DP switch banks which have 
gaps (unused switches) in them. These switches are now grayed out.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Another Amiga update: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Fixed blitter in line mode
 - Modified Copper to run on odd memory bus cycles
 - Fixed screen delay offset when display data fetch is not word 
    aligned

Fixed cheat searching. [stephh]

Replaced CPS2 CHDs with preliminary decryption function.
[Andreas Naive, Nicola Salmoria]

Added code to validate that banks are only set to point to memory
that has been allocated via auto_malloc(). Currently disabled
pending further review. [Nathan Woods]

Updated input port tokenization for MESS. Added support in MAME
for "configuration" switches which are separate from DIP switches.
These can be used to configure aspects of the game that don't
correspond to DIP switches. Modified pacman.c to use configurations
to control the speedup options. [Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Fixed invalid array access in the taito_l driver. [Atari Ace]

Made a fix minor compiler compatibility tweaks to the source.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed several glitches and crashes related to the input port and
unicode changes from u2. [Aaron Giles]

Separated "core" OSD function definitions to osdcore.h. Added more
extensive documentation. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new library called osdcore, which is now built and linked
to each executable. Moved all definitions of expected components of
osdcore into new header file osdcore.h, and added consistent
documentation for them all. Removed osd_tool.c, and moved the 
necessary parts of its functionality into osdcore. [Aaron Giles]

Defined a new set of interfaces for osdcore which creates an
abstract interface for queueing work items to be potentially executed
on a secondary thread. Implemented the Windows versions of these
routines, but have not done any testing yet. [Aaron Giles]

Separated Windows OSD core routines into individual files, as
folows:
  windir.c  - directory-related core OSD functions
  winfile.c - file-related core OSD functions
  winmisc.c - miscellaneous core OSD functions
  winsync.c - synchronization-related core OSD functions
  wintime.c - timing-related core OSD functions
  winwork.c - threading-related core OSD functions
[Aaron Giles]

Created new osdmini directory with minimal implementations of all the 
OSD core routines. These can be used to stub in functionality or as
a starting point for new ports. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up chdman, normalizing its behavior and improving error
reporting. [Aaron Giles]

More updates to the laserdisc emulation, based on more complete
understanding of how the discs are encoded and how they will 
eventually be stored. [Aaron Giles]

MAMETesters bugs fixed (there are probably more)
-----------------------
tourtabl0111u1red [Nathan Woods]


Source Changes
--------------

Amiga core system updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Updated 6526/8520 CIA to be able to set the value of the SP pin.  
    This is needed to emulate the Amiga keyboard.
 - Updated the custom chips emulation to delay for about 24 cycles 
    the issuing of interrupts after a write to INTENA or INTREQ. 
 - Fixed a bug where if INTREQ got cleared programatically, it would 
    'forget' about pending CIA interrupts, causing the CIA to stop 
    sending further interrupts.
 - Fixed the interrupt delay logic. Now it properly delays firing 
    the irqs, not the masking/disabling.
 - Fixed return value for unused/invalid custom registers reads.
 - Added Denise ID custom register to properly identify OCS, ECS and 
    AGA
 - Added reset to custom, autoconfig and cia when a RESET opcode is 
    found.
 - Resetting the custom chips will now clear INTENA, preventing 
    further interrupts.
 - Fixed a bug in the RBF interrupt request code check.
 - Fixed a bug on the 6526/8520 CIA that prevented chained counters 
    from working.
 - Added support for the 'blitter-nasty' bit on the blitter. Fixes 
    many games that displayed wrong graphics.

Hooked up coin counter in Gun Fight. Also connected sounds properly 
per schematics. Added proper watchdogs to invaders and invad2ct.
[Derrick Renaud]

Added missing initialization to the TMS5220 RNG. [Lord Nightmare]

Taito JC driver improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Implemented MC68HC11 communications
 - Added analog controls via MC68HC11
 - Various bug fixes and some new opcodes to the TMS320C51 core
 - Moved video hardware emulation to vidhrdw/taitojc.c
 - Implemented 3D hardware emulation

Cleaned up the 8080bw sound changes included with u1. [Robert]

Changed 6532riot and tia code to only allow initialization at init 
time. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed several bugs in the old System 16 bootleg code. [Mamesick]

Fixed SIM opcode in i8085 emulator. [Tomasz Slanina]

Initial support for Unicode in the core and Windows OSD: [Nathan Woods]
 - text file reading/writing now automatically handle UTF-8 conversion
 - a number of Windows functions internally manage TCHARs
 - new Windows compile-time option UNICODE can be used to build MAME
    as a Unicode application (see windows.mak)

Added new visible representation of physical DIP switches for drivers
that have them defined. To see this, just pull up the DIP switch
menu on drivers that have been documented. [Brian Oberholtzer]

Corrected some incorrect DIP switch information in the 1942, toaplan2,
and segag80r drivers. [Brian Oberholtzer]

Added the remaining MESS CPU cores to MAME. They are disabled in the
build, but will be maintained along with the MAME CPU cores as future
changes are made. [Nathan Woods]

Added support for multiple instances of the samples sound system.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Converted input port definitions from code-based constructors to
data-driven tokenized values. This reduces the overall MAME code size
by a significant amount. Note that the tokenization is a bit
different for 32-bit versus 64-bit builds, so hopefully somebody
with a 64-bit system can verify that it works (mame -listxml should
produce identical results to the 32-bit version). 
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Properly implemented sound interrupts in Night Slashers. [Aaron Giles]

Improved cycle timings in the ARM CPU core. Altered the deco32 CPU
clocks to be more realistic. [Aaron Giles]

Updated copyright dates in header files and docs. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------

Added more documentation for the 8080bw driver. It describes the ports 
and bits for those games with no sound. In most cases, sample sounds 
have been attached, in order to assist with further development. The 
games modified are: invrvnge/invrvnga, rollingc, spcenctr, gunfight, 
m4, gmissile, schasrcv, 280zzzap, lagunar, lupin3, phantom2, blueshrk, 
desertgu, ballbomb, yosakdon/yosakdoa, and shuttlei. Two games were 
marked NO_SOUND although they actually do have sound: these are cosmo 
and dogpatch. [Robert]

Moved a chunk of platform specific code out of chdcd.c and romcmp.c 
into the osd_tool code. [Nathan Woods]

Widespread cleanup of disassemblers and CPU interfaces across the 
project: [Giuseppe Gorgoglione]
 - removed from many disassemblers the dependency on eainfo.h. The 
    output produced by those disassemblers has been checked to be the 
    same as before.
 - extensively rewrote the 6309dasm.c and 6809dasm.c disassemblers.
 - fixed minor bugs in the v810 and hd6309 interfaces.
 - removed m68000\cpudefs.h. This was used by the old assembly m68000 
    core. Removed from m68kmame.c and m68kmame.h as well many 
    references to the old core (e.g A68K0, A68K2, etc.)
 - properly typedeffed the cpuinfo union, this affects cpuintrf.h and 
    many, many, other files
 - converted 8051dasm.c, m65ce02.c and t11dasm.c to use 
    cpuintrf_temp_str() instead of local string pools
 - moved the info.s = cpuintrf_temp_str() initialization to:
    activecpu_get_info_string(), cpunum_get_info_string() and 
    cputype_get_info_string(). This allows us to remove tons of 
    info->s = cpuintrf_temp_str() statements from the xxx_get_info() 
    accessors of every CPU core, making them more readable
 
Fixed a problem with the chirp tables of both the tms5220 and the 
tms5110. Also backported Jarek's PRNG implementation from tms5110.c 
to tms5220.c so it no longer relies on rand(). [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed two bugs in the m68000 core: [Alex Jackson]
 - fixed a miscompilation issue with GCC4 that was first noticed in 
    Altered Beast but also affected Moonwalker, Galaxy Force 2, and 
    probably many other games.  
 - fixed the core's compile-time self-configuration so that it uses 
    the same code paths on LP64 platforms (64-bit Linux, etc.) as on
    LLP64 (64-bit Windows) and 32-bit platforms.

Added save state support to the magmax driver. [Svante Gerhard]

Fixed music speed in perfrman. [Mamesick]

Fixed implementation of da_a instruction in i8051 core. [Special LIU]

Third round of numerous improvements to the cheat engine: [ShimaPong]
NOTE : delete old command code and save it newly in Options menu.
 * operation:
   - Added preliminary direct Program Space accessor.
     You can hack custom handling ROM code (eg encrypted segas16b.c
     games). But it has several problems.
     And added watchpoint display for Program Space.
   - Added new operation, "Write if Match".
     The cheat engine writes value only when read value matched
     reserved value which is stored in extend data field.
 * search menu:
   - Added 3rd search mode, "Minimum Search Mode". It's more simple
     than Classic Mode. Also added search memory initialize with
     ui_clear key and extended value edit with arrow key in this mode.
   - Added "View Last Results", "Restore Result", "Region Selection"
     items to the advanced search menu.
 * result viewer:
   - Don't open this menu to avoid MAME crash in case of
     no search region like sms.c in HazeMD.
   - Added quick page switch by left/right arrow key.
     Also changed functions for several keys in this menu.
   - Improved no result page skip. But incomplete because
     doesn't skip first or last page even if no result.
 * code loading:
   - Ignored to load old format code by default. If you need to
     load, choose "Load Old Format" item in Options menu.
 * input:
   - Fixed activation key save on Enable/Disable menu.
   - Fixed key handling for watch code addition from watch list
     menu to cheat list. Now it works with ctrl + save cheat
     key on the watch list menu.
   - Enabled ui_clear key in editing a value (clear data)
     and on watch list menu (reset all watchpoints).
