Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- 16 bit support in the tilemap manager, so the Namco System 2 games no longer
  require -depth 8. [Phil Stroffolino]

- [DOS] Changed the -depth option behaviour, now it can be either 8, 16, or
  auto. The default is auto, which uses the color depth appropriate for the
  game. 8 forces use of a 256 colors display (faster but less accurate), 16
  forces use of a 16-bit display (not suggested, doesn't work with all games).
  MAKE SURE TO SET depth = auto IN MAME.CFG, OR YOU'LL USE 16-BIT IN ALL GAMES.

- Fixed a few bugs in the NEC CPU core that caused problems in Hook, Gunforce,
  Lethal Thunder and maybe others. [Bryan McPhail, Nao]

- Several changes and improvements to the TMS34010 emulation and to the
  Williams games using CVSD sound. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.27 WIP.

- Replaced MachineDriver->video_attributes VIDEO_SUPPORTS_16BIT with
  GameDriver->flags GAME_REQUIRES_16BIT.
  Added color_depth to struct RunningMachine and struct GameOptions. OS
  dependant code may set it to force a specific depth.
  Added depth parameter to osd_create_display(). The OS dependant code MUST
  respect it - if it has special requirements, it must set the GameOptions
  flag beforehand.

- Calling palette_recalc() is now *MANDATORY* in all drivers that modify the
  palette. The palette will not be updated otherwise.

- Removed adpcm_sample_list, palette and colortable from struct GameDriver.
  Changed char *color_prom to int prom_memory_region.

- Updated the TMS9900 emulator. [Raphael Nabet]
