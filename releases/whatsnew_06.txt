Program:
- Support for:
  Scramble (wrong colors, no sound)
  Uniwars (US version of Japanese Irem game)
  Frogger (including bootleg version running on a Scramble board)
    (wrong colors, no sound)
  Amidar (wrong colors, no sound)
  Turtles (wrong colors, no sound)
  Rally X (wrong colors, no sound, slowdowns)

- I'm beginning to understand how the Wizard of Wor video hardware works,
  gameplay hasn't changed but the graphics are more faithfully reproduced.

- Star background in Galaxians & co. The way I calculate it is probably not
  correct, anyway it looks reasonable.

- Fixed staccato notes in Pacman and other games using the same hardware.
  There are still some minor glitches (especially in Ms. Pac Man) but Pac Man
  tunes are now very close to the original.

Source:
- I reorganized the source directory tree, instead of one directory for every
  game there are now four directories (drivers, machine, vidhrdw, sndhrdw)
  which contain files named after the game.
