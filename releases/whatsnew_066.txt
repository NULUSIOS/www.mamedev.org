MAME Testers bugs to check
--------------------------

mrheli37b2gre   - I believe this was fixed some time ago


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Fixed samples in Pachinko Sexy Reaction [Suppi-Chan]

- Major improvements to the Namco NA sound emulation. [cync]

- Sound in IQ Block. [David Haywood]

- Fixed drums in Exterminator [Steve Ellenoff, Jim Hernandez]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Misc improvements to the Namco NA driver. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Several improvements and games additions to the Nintendo VS and Playchoice
  drivers. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

- Several fixes to Super Real Darwin [Acho A. Tang]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New option -high_priority to increase the thread priority so MAME runs better
  while other programs are running. It is off by default because enabling it
  might make MAME use too much CPU time.

- Major update to the discrete sound system. This includes adjustable parameters
  controls in the UI, fixes to existing games, and new sound support in canyon,
  polaris, sprint and ultratnk. [Derrick Renaud & Keith Wilkins]

- Fixed some bugs in the I86/NEC CPU emulation. This includes raster effect
  problems in Geostorm and the 99 credits bug in Lethal Thunder. [Bryan McPhail]
