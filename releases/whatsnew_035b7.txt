0.35 BETA 7

New games supported:
--------------------

The Battle-Road [Eric Hustvedt]


New clones supported:
---------------------

Block Block (bootleg) [Nicola Salmoria]
TNZS (bbotleg) [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Added the missing background layer to Cobra Command. [Bryan McPhail]

- Colors & sprites in Super Real Darwin should be correct. [Bryan McPhail]

- Char/sprite priority in Lode Runner 2 & 3 and in Battle Road. [Eric Hustvedt]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed the in game timer in Captain Silver, this probably fixes other
  gameplay glitches. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed controls in Gondomania and Last Mission. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- new switch "-waitvsync /-nowaitvsync" (use it with -novsync); it waits for
  video sync before drawing the screen but uses the normal MAME throttling.
  This gives smoother display with scrolling game (like vsync), but works
  with video modes with higher refresh frequency, and is more win-friendly.
  [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- Major overhaul to the cpu cores. Note that the debugger doesn't work in this
  release. [Juergen Buchmueller]
