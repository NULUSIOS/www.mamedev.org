-nes, snes: Working MIDI in and out for Miracle Piano [R. Belmont]

-fixed missing file details [Oliver St√∂neberg]

-snes: converted input code to use slot devices. This means that
 you now change the emulated controllers (Joypad, Mouse, Multitap,
 Super Scope) via the Slot Device menu of the UI interface and not
 anymore from the System Configurations menu. Also, changing controller
 now requires to reset the system, so please take some timeto choose
 the desired controller *before* starting the game, if you want to play
 a game that uses special controllers. [Fabio Priuli]

-snes: fixed Mouse emulation so that it does not jump back
 erratically if you keep moving beyond the window border. [Fabio
 Priuli]

-snes: fixed Multitap Adapter emulation so games properly
 recognize the device and inputs from all 5 controllers are accepted by
 the games. [Fabio Priuli]

-snes: added emulation of the Pachinko controller used by a few

-snes: added emulation of the Yonezawa Twin Tap controllers,
