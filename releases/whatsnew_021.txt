Program:
- I'd like to say I'v finished, but Nicola is too fast as always! ;)
  So thanks to Nicola we have GALAGA!!  And very special thanks to Martin
  Scragg that provided us crucial information on custon I/O chips.

- Thanks to Dark Schneider (DS wanted to be anonymous, so I'll call him
  this way) that provided 6809 support and the first driver working on this
  CPU: Super Pac Man.  The driver is based on the super-detailed KEG file
  of Replay emulator by Kevin Brisley (kevin@isgtec.com).
  Thanks to everyone.

- Ville Laitinen provided a driver for Kangaroo, based on the Arabian
  hardware.  I'v also adjusted the number of frames per second to 60
  to the two drivers.  Sync with sound should be better, though.

- Thank to Virtu-Al (Alan J McCormick (gonzothegreat@JUNO.COM)) Amidar
  and Turtles now have 100% correct colors.

- Arabian has correct colors now.

- Fixed a bug in all games with starbackground:  using a frameskip > 0
  introduced slowdowns.  Now the speed remains unchanged.

- Fixed tempo speed in 1942.  It was playing at half speed. Should be
  correct now.  Also fixed a bug in noise volume of PSG.  Noise was
  playing at half volume.

- Added support for Donkey Kong japanese version

- Minor adjustment to Space Invaders color strips

- Mad Planets doesn't crash anymore with the new samples (shorter!)

- Added colors to Warp Warp.  Thanks again Chris.

- Fixed Dipswitch in Elevator Action.  YOU'LL HAVE TO DELETE THE PREVIOUS
  DSW FILE IN "ELEVATOB" DIRECTORY IN ORDER TO GET IT RUN CORRECTLY.

Sources:
- Added M6809 CPU support.  Changes in CPUIntrf.c and Driver.h to accomodate
  the new CPU.

- Nicola introduced changes to the Z80 emulator code that intercept some
  sorts of tight loop used during an interrupt waitstate.  Normal games
  should not be affected, while Galaga and 1942 are now very fast!!

- Added MasterVolume in MSDOS.C, and changed MAME.C to support this feature.
  You can change the volume thru various volume percentage [100,75,50,25,0]
  pressing F9.

- Sound is freezed now during GFXView, Pause and DipSwitch settings.[Ahhh! ;)]

- I'v added redefinable keys in MAME.  A new structure cointains which
  input ports and bits have a certain meaning.  The KEY settings will be
  saved in a .KEY file, in the game directory.

- Changes in COMMON.H for the sample structure.  Now it has infos on
  replayrate, resolution and volume of the sample to be played.
  BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE NEW SET OF SAMPLES, OR THE "MAMESAM" CONVERTER
  OR YOU WILL GET NO SOUND FOR SAMPLE BASED GAMES!!
