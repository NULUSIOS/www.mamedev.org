IMPORTANT NOTE: This will be the last version of MAME released by me (Nicola
Salmoria). From now on, the project will be maintained by Mirko Buffoni
(mix@lim.dsi.unimi.it). Contact him if you have material to submit for
inclusion into MAME. Please don't send such material to me.


Program:
- Green Beret:
  - The speed should now be VERY accurate. It also syncs correctly with the
    music.
  - Sound pitch should be correct as well (though it changes after you die
    for the first time...)
  - High score support.
  - Fixed sprite clipping problem on the left of the screen.
  - Fixed memory trashing bug in dirtybuffer handling

- I finally added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator.
  This affects Lady Bug and Green Beret.

- I also added the same lousy noise to Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon
  Quasar.

- Fixed bug in the 8910 emulation which caused noise to be played in Crazy
  Kong when you jumped over a barrel.

- Zaxxon and Congo Bongo now save their high scores for real. The code had
  disappeared from the drivers... I _did_ write it, since I had .hi files in
  my directories ;-)

- High score support in Space Invaders (Invaders only - not clones)

- Bomb Jack is much faster on a 486. Now runs very well with -frameskip 1 on
  my 486/100.

- Sprite placement in Pac Man, Ms Pac Man and Crush Roller should now be
  arcade perfect. Thanks to Richard Davies who verified it on a real machine.

- Preliminary support for Jungle King / Jungle Hunt. Slow but playable. I
  haven't the gfx bank selector, therefore you'll have to pick the correct
  background graphics yourself. Use keys C and V to change it.

- VERY preliminary support for Elevator Action. Not playable.

- Preliminary support for Seicross, using the Crazy Kong driver. Not playable.

- Marc Lafontaine fixed some problems in the Venture driver, and provided
  drivers for Mouse Trap and Pepper II, which run on similar hardware (Pepper
  II is not complete yet).
  Note that the required Venture ROM set has changed - the other one was
  missing one ROM.
  Collision detection doesn't work - in Mouse Trap, you can use keys 7 and 8
  to simulate a sprite-to-character and a sprite-to-sprite collision.

- Rotated the controls for Q*Bert

- Some changes to music tempo in Amidar, Pooyan, Time Pilot.

- Added support for the original, Universal version of Mr. Do!. I renamed the
  other, which has an additional Taito copyright notice, "mrdot".

- Support for a version of Crazy Kong running on Scramble hardware

- Mike Coates provided a Space Panic driver.

- Fixed bugs in Jump Bug and Bagman sound drivers which caused page faults
  when run under DOS.

- Fabrice Frances submitted a much faster version of the 8086 emulation.
  Q*Bert now runs at full speed with -frameskip 1 on my 486/100.

Source:
- Samples are now loadaed by the main engine, not the single drivers. This is
  done via the new field samplenames in the GameDriver structure. Samples can
  then be retrieved by the drivers in Machine->samples.
