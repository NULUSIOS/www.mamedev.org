Source:
-------

- stream_init() and stream_init_multi() no longer have a sample_bits parameter.
  Sound emulators are required to generate 16-bit samples. Also removed
  osd_play_streamed_sample() and mixer_play_streamed_sample(): only the 16-bit
  version is available now.

- Added gain support to mixer.c, through the new MIXERG() macro (extension of
  MIXER()). Removed the gain filed from AY8910, YM2204, YM2610 structures.

- make68k.exe now requires as parameter the path of the comptab.asm include
  file (see makefile).
