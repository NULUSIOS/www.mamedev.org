Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

  instead of truncating the least significant 8 bits. [Jarek Burczynski]

- [DOS] There are now two options for Hot Rod key mapping, -hotrod and
  -hotrodse. The latter remaps NeoGeo games to use the lower row of buttons.


Source:
-------

- There's a new game flag GAME_NO_COCKTAIL to mark drivers that don't support
  screen flip, please use it because gamelist.txt is now generated
  automatically and this is the only way to know whether a driver supports
  it or not.

- TMS36XX emulation (Phoenix, Pleiads, Naughty Boy, Pop Flamer, Monster
  Bash). [Juergen Buchmueller]
