Source:
-------

- The transition to the GAME() macro is complete. struct GameDriver must no
  longer be used. Alro removed the old ROM_REGION() and ROM_REGION_DISPOSE()
  macros, and renamed ROM_REGIONX() to ROM_REGION().

- The functionality of osd_skip_this_frame() is now more strictly defined (see
  osdepend.h). Ports not complying with that must be updated, otherwise
  problems with certain drivers might arise.

- mixer.c now does all sound mixing, generating one single sample stream,
  played using the new osd_XXX_audio_stream() functions.
  All other OS dependant sample functions (osd_play_sample() etc.) have been
  removed. This should standardize the sound output across ports, and allow
  porters to write much cleaner sound code. [Aaron Giles]

- Removed some obsolete fields from struct GameOptions.
