 older dumps. [TeamEurope]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
-Sega VMU added more bioses [El Barto]

-qx10: Downgrade floppies to DD [O. Galibert]

-super6: Added original BIOS. [Al Kossow]

-APC: Fixed a few missing keys (a few are still missing though),
 and hooked the rtc clock, command and strobe lines up in a plausible
 configuration. The status line clock now works though shows an invalid
 value for year (the upd1990a didn't have a year response, so perhaps
 whatever rtc is being used here is a later variant which does store a
 year). The "date set" command doesn't work properly and doesn't even
 seem to poke the rtc at all. Needs further investigation.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-z800x: Fixed some incorrect opcodes and address register math in
 segment mode.  Olivetti M20 now can boot PCOS to the prompt.
 [Christian Grössler]

-Minor fix to the character tile row ordering in apc
 [Lord Nightmare]

-esq5505 updates [Christian Brunschen, R. Belmont]
 * Fixed up clocks for 21 vs. 32-voice models
 * Added ROMs for the 12-bit sample region on the SD-1 and SD-1
    32-voice
 * Minor cleanups

-Fixed upd765 SIS status when fid = 4, this makes NEC PC-88VA to
 attempt to DMA from floppy. [Angelo Salese]

-bw2: Fix disk select and quick hack to make the timings work
 [O. Galibert]

-Olivetti M20: improved keyboard and floppy handling
 [Christian Grössler]

 preliminary LED hookup [R. Belmont]

 to any vMac/BasiliskII compatible image under 256 MB, including HD
 floppies.  Disk is bootable if set in the control panel but only 
 can eject from Finder.
 [Rob Braun, R. Belmont]

-nubus_image: revised firmware allows multiple cards to work
 [Rob Braun]

-nubus_image: add eject/insert support [Rob Braun]

-vt100: updated a bunch of driver notes and rom defs to reflect current
 research [Lord Nightmare]

-sf7000: Verified floppy format gap sizes. [Curt Coder]

-vt100: Verified that the checksum of the typed-from-manual
 23-018e2 character generator ROM matches the dump from the actual
 chip. [Lou Ernst Jr.]

-sms.c: Improved support for '3-D' games.  [Enik Land]

-dc: Added European DC bios 1.01c [BadAd84]

-mackbd: dumped correct ROM, prep for actual emulation
 [Lord Nightmare, R. Belmont]

-a7800.c: Adjusted colorburst/tint/hue of entire palette to closer reflect
 default hardware configuration setting of ~180 degrees
 [i.e. $17 = 179.92706396 & $18 = 179.927063726]. [Robert Tuccitto]
