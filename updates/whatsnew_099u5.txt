Source Changes
--------------
Completed renaming of core structures. Most pervasive change was "struct
tilemap" is now just "tilemap". [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the Cinematronics vector games. [Buddabing]

Added blending to the alt tilemap code in psikyosh.c, fixing the final
boss in Sol Divide. [David Haywood]

Improvements to the Witch/Pinball Champ '95 driver: [Sebasten Hegon]
 * The games now show some graphics (the palette seems OK) and play some 
    music and sounds.
 * Since the controls are not yet figured out completely, they are still 
    mapped as dipswitches.
 * An NVRAM reset is required the first time you launch Witch (via the 
    associated dipswitch). Pinball Champ seems to automatically do this.
 * The sound part required some patching in sound/es8712.c. I disabled 
    the hardcoded inconditional looping, and made the sound start when 
    writing at offset 0x06 (cf patch). vmetal does not seem to be affected.
 * As far as gameplay is concerned, the ball will freeze (in game and 
    demo mode), and I don't know why. The video hardware is not completely 
    figured out and may be the culprit.
 * The coin in/out mecanism needs some work too.

Some improvements to Jolly Card: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added extra hardware info (pinouts and dips).
 * Added the correct dipswitch to Jolly Card. Hopper and Points/pulse not 
    tested due to preliminary driver state. The rest are working properly.
    Remember to delete the nvram and reinitialize to see some changes.
 * Added almost the same dipswitch to Magic Card II (Bulgaria).

Significant changes to the save state system: [Aaron Giles]
 * Added alternate save state pre-/post-load function types that take
    integer or pointer parameters. Updated several sound cores and other 
    files to take advantage of this.
 * Made state handler registrations track like other scoped resources
    (timers, memory) so that registrations can occur as late as 
    MACHINE_INIT time.
 * Added logic to detect registrations after MACHINE_INIT time and prevent
    saves in that case.
 * Added logic to detect when CPUs or sound chips haven't registered 
    anything to save/load. When this happens, info is logged to error.log
    and saves/loads are disallowed.
 * Allocated timers are now automatically saved and restored as part of
    the save state. The global time is now restored as well as a bunch of
    CPU execution state. This should produce more reliable restores.
 * Added logic to defer saves until all anonymous timers have cleared. If 
    a driver uses many anonymous timers it may not be possible to ever 
    successfully save, so the operation will time out after one second.
 * Before restoring, the machine is now reset. This gives a more
    consistent environment for the load to occur.
 * Re-enabled save state support for YM2151.
 * Added save state support to the classic Namco sound system.
 * Added save state support to the samples sound system.
 * Removed anonymous timer usage in machine/scramble.c.

Source Changes
--------------
Added memory card and cheat menus back into the system. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed MNG recording problem that was introduced in u3. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed crash when running vector games that was introduced in u3.
[Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up/normalized the naming of several core structures in an
attempt to impose some order on coding conventions in the core code:
  struct InputPortDefinition   -> input_port_default_entry
  struct InputPort             -> input_port_entry
  struct RegionInfo            -> region_info
  struct RunningMachine        -> running_machine
  struct GameOptions           -> global_options
  struct GameDriver            -> game_driver
  struct InternalMachineDriver -> machine_config
  struct MachineCPU            -> cpu_config
  struct MachineSoundRoute     -> sound_route
  struct MachineSound          -> sound_config
  struct MachineSpeaker        -> speaker_config
  struct RomModule             -> rom_entry
  struct SystemBios            -> bios_entry
  struct GfxLayout             -> gfx_layout
  struct GfxElement            -> gfx_element
  struct GfxDecodeInfo         -> gfx_decode
Plus many others along the same lines (follow the pattern). Note that this
work is not yet complete. In addition, a few of the more pervasive structs 
(mame_bitmap, rectangle) will be left until a non-diff release (0.100).
[Aaron Giles]

Removed -skip_disclaimer since it automatically goes away after the first
time execution. [Aaron Giles]

Created new NMK112 ROM banking module and connected it up to a number of
drivers that made use of it. Affected games are in cave.c, nmk16.c, 
powerins.c, quizpani.c, toaplan2.c. [Alex W. Jackson]

Added missing buttons to Showdown. [David Widel]

Fixed the PULUW instruction on the 6309 disassembler. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed the state save facility play better on multisession ports if 
initialization fails. [Tim Lindner]
