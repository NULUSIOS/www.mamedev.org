-pc: remove unused ibm5150_ppi8255_interface [shattered]
 pc, ec1841: unbreak DBG_LOG macro
 mc1502: FDC xtal freq is 16 MHz
 asst128: another PC XT clone
 ec1841: add softlist, set 'v2' as default BIOS to avoid resets

-nes.c: greatly improved save state stability, by adding
 registration of on-cart VRAM/WRAM. [Fabio Priuli]

-gameboy/gbcolor: simplified video code by reducing the number
 of memory pointers used, and added support for save state
 registration. [Fabio Priuli]

-slotify pc joystick [Carl]

-Apollo updates: [Hans Ostermeyer]
 * Added 4 and 8 plane color graphics board support
 * Renamed dn3x00 to dn3x00_19i and dn3x00_15i to dn3x00
 * Reworked video/apollo.c into class apollo_graphics
